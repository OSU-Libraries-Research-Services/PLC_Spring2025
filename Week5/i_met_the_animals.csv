0, Alpaca,Lama pacos,Mammalia,Artiodactyla,Camelidae,Lama pacos,"Alpacas are slender-bodied animals with long legs and necks, small heads and large, pointed ears. They are covered in a soft fleece that is virtually free of guard hair and occurs in a variety of colors. Alpacas have soft, padded feet that leave even the most delicate grasses and terrain undamaged as they graze. The two types of alpacas are huacaya and suri.
Ninety-five percent of alpacas are huacayas. Their crimpy fiber grows perpendicular to the skin, giving them a wooly appearance. Suris have straight fiber that curls toward the ground, hanging in ""dreadlocks."" However, because of their finer, less dense coat, the suri is not quite as adept at withstanding severe weather. The suri is rarer with only about 5,000 registered in the United States.
The Smithsonian's National Zoo exhibits huacaya alpaca. Alpacas have no top, front teeth. An adult male alpaca's upper and lower incisors and lower canines develop into fighting teeth or fangs that can be more than 1.2 inches (3 centimeters) long. These teeth do not develop as much in females. Aside from this difference in tooth morphology, sexual dimorphism is minimal in alpacas.","Alpacas are the smallest of the domesticated camelid species. Adult alpacas usually range from 100 to 200 pounds (45 to 90 kilograms). Their head and body length ranges from 47 to 85 inches (1.2 to 2.2 meters), and their tail length ranges from 6 to 10 inches (150 to 220 millimeters). Their shoulder height is typically 32 to 40 inches (0.8 to 1.1 meters).
Huacaya alpaca have a birth weight of between 10 and 17 pounds (4.5 to 7.7 kilograms) and grow to an adult weight of between 100 and 190 pounds (45.3 to 86.1 kilograms). Adults stand 32 to 39 inches (81.2 to 99 centimeters) tall at the shoulder.","Alpacas are one of the domesticated members of the camel (camelid) family, which also includes llamas, guanacos and vicunas from South America, and the Bactrian and Dromedary camels from Asia and Africa. This family of animals originated on the plains of North America about 10 million years ago. A common ancestor to the South American camelids migrated there about 2.5 million years ago. Two wild species, vicunas and guanacos, still live in the Andes today.
Researchers believe that alpacas were developed through selective breeding that was heavily influenced by the vicuna more than 6,000 years ago. Alpacas and wild vicunas are similar in size, fiber and dentition (teeth). Of all the animals found in the Americas prior to European colonization, llamas and their alpaca cousins had the most influence. Like the buffalo of the Great Plains, both species were a source of meat, fuel and hides.
But unlike buffalo, alpacas and llamas were fully domesticated animals, created centuries before the Incas by Andean people who bred wild forms of South American camelids and clearly appreciated the myriad of benefits woven alpaca fiber offered against the harsh environment in which they lived.
As in ancient days, alpacas are important to Andean herders, providing luxury fiber and meat. Their compact size contributes to easy management and to desirability as a companion animal. Alpacas easily learn to lead, jump in and out of vehicles, cush (sit down) and obey other simple commands. Alpacas are shorn for their valuable fleeces. Males produce approximately 8 pounds and females about 5 pounds of easily marketable fiber from their coats per year.
Alpacas exhibit a variety of natural colors, with approximately 22 basic fiber colors and many variations and blends. Alpaca fiber has a cellular structure similar to hair and is more resilient and much stronger than Merino sheep wool. It is highly sought after in Britain, Europe and Japan.",Not Evaluated,"It is believed that more than 6,000 years ago, alpacas were developed through selective breeding heavily influenced by the wild vicuna.
Alpacas were fully domesticated by Andean people centuries before the Incas as a source of fuel, meat and fiber for fabric.",This animal is currently on exhibit
1, Alligator snapping turtle,Macroclemys temminckii,Reptilia,Testudines,Chelydridae,Macroclemys temminckii,"The alligator snapping turtle's defining characteristics are its large head, strong jaws and hooked beak. It has a spiked, dark-brown carapace. Alligator snapping turtles have long, narrow tongues equipped with an appendage that looks like a worm to attract prey. Algae growing on these turtles' backs lends camouflage among the muddy river beds they inhabit.",Males can weigh up to 90 kilograms (200 pounds) with a carapace length of up to 80 centimeters (31 inches).,"Alligator snapping turtles are native to the southern United States. They are found in rivers and streams that feed into the Gulf of Mexico. Their range stretches from Iowa, west into Texas, and east into Georgia and northern Florida.  Genetic analyses revealed that there are three genetically distinct subpopulations of alligator snapping turtles, residing in the greater Mississippi River watershed, the Gulf coastal rivers east of the Mississippi River and the Suwannee River drainage system in Florida.
Alligator snapping turtles are predominantly aquatic, spending most of their time in the water. They can stay submerged for 40 to 50 minutes before needing to surface for air. They are only found in freshwater systems and tend to prefer the deeper beds of large rivers, canals and lakes. However, juveniles may be found in smaller streams.",Vulnerable,"Alligator snapping turtles are the largest freshwater turtles in the world.
An appendage on the alligator snapping turtle's tongue resembles a worm, helping this ambush predator lure prey.",This animal is currently on exhibit
2, Alligator lizard,Abronia graminea,Reptilia,Squamata,Anguidae,Abronia graminea,"Alligator lizards range from teal blue to deep green with pale yellow bellies and a yellow ring around each eye. Males tend to be more vibrant than females, while juveniles are paler and marked with dark, lateral stripes.
The alligator lizard has a triangular head and a prehensile tail that helps them climb and navigate through treetops.",This species can grow up to about 9.8 inches (25 centimeters) long.,"These lizards are native to the Mexican states of Veracruz and Pueblo.  They are arboreal, meaning they live in trees, and are most commonly found 130 feet (40 meters) above the forest floor.
Their preferred habitat is the humid canopy of cloud forests, among bromeliads and dense vegetation. Alligator lizards are typically found at elevations of 4,500-9,000 feet (1,350-2,740 meters).",Endangered,"Alligator lizards typically live 130 feet above the forest floor.

3, Allen's swamp monkey,Allenopithecus nigroviridis,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Allenopithecus nigroviridis,"Allen's swamp monkeys are small and stout. Their fur is brown, gray and green and grows longer around the neck and shoulders than on the rest of the body. Their tails are generally longer than their bodies.","Adults may reach 18 inches (45.7 centimeters) in body length with tails over 19 inches (48.2 centimeters) in length. Males are noticeably larger than females and can exceed 13 pounds (5.9 kilograms), while females are closer to 7.5 pounds (3.4 kilograms).","Allen's swamp monkeys are native to central Africa and are primarily concentrated in the lowland forests of the Congo basin, which includes Cameroon, Congo and Democratic Republic of the Congo. As their name suggests, Allen's swamp monkeys inhabit swamp forests. Water is central to their habitat, and groups may even choose to sleep near bodies of water.",Least concern,"Though they are largely arboreal, spending much of their time in the trees, these monkeys will occasionally come to the ground to forage.
Allen's swamp monkeys are highly social primates that communicate with members of their troops using gestures and calls.",This animal is currently on exhibit
4, Aldabra tortoise,Geochelone gigantea,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Geochelone gigantea,"Aldabra tortoises' carapace (or upper shell) has a small neck plate that is usually visible, a feature absent in other species of giant tortoises. The males have a concave plastron (belly shell) that aids in mating. They are dark gray to black in color with a highly domed, thick carapace. They have long necks, which helps with food gathering. The hind legs are cylindrical and columnar like those of an elephant; thick, often bony scales cover them. The toes are short and two-jointed. The head is relatively small, pointed and covered by scales.
A rare subspecies of Aldabra tortoise has been discovered in approximately ten zoos around the United States. The Aldabra tortoises at the Reptile Discovery Center have not yet been DNA tested to determine if they fall under this category.","Aldabras are one of the world's largest land tortoises. Males are considerably larger than females and have longer, thicker tails. The male's carapace length can measure 4 feet (1.22 meters) and they can weigh up to 550 pounds (250 kilograms). The female's carapace can measure 3 feet (91 centimeters) and can weigh 350 pounds (159 kilograms). An Aldabra tortoise weighing 672 pounds (305 kilograms) is the world's largest free-roaming tortoise ever recorded.","They are found on Aldabra Island, one of the Seychelles northeast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. They were apparently introduced to Mauritius and Reunion Islands.
Aldabra Island is a coral atoll bordered by jagged limestone and small beaches and encloses a large mangrove-bordered lagoon. The tortoises live in habitats such as scrub, mangrove swamp and coastal dunes. The largest concentration of tortoises is found in the grasslands called platins.",Vulnerable,"Aldabra tortoises are easily domesticated and can learn to identify their keepers in a short time.
Aldabra tortoises can reach ages of over 150 years.",This animal is currently on exhibit
5, African plated lizard,Gerrhosaurus validus,Reptilia,Squamata,Cordylidae,Gerrhosaurus validus,"There are 30 species of plated lizards, and African plated lizards (also called giant plated lizards) are one of the largest. They have thick bodies and powerful legs, which aid in both speed and digging. They have black, rubber-like balls on the soles of their feet.
Adult African plated lizards have black or brown scales on their backs, called dorsal scales. Each dorsal scale is spotted with yellow. The plates on their heads, called head shields, are also yellow. Their throats are an off-white color, and their bellies are light brown. Juveniles are black with yellow spots on their backs and yellow stripes on the sides of their bodies.
African plated lizards' dorsal scales are small with many ridges, with give them a serrated appearance. Their lower eyelids are also covered with small scales. They have large, triangular scales on their cheeks, called tympanic shields. Their abdomens are lined with rows of plates, which are specialized bones in the skin that provide support for the scales.
There are two subspecies of African plated lizards, Gerrhosauraus validus validus and Gerrhosaurus validus maltzahni. The subspecies G. v. maltzahni has 12-14 rows of plates on its abdomen, called ventral plates. Small scales, called suboculars, also border its upper lip. The subspecies G. v. validus, which is found in the eastern part of the African plated lizard's range, has 14-16 ventral plates and no suboculars on its top lip.
Plated lizards have a groove, called the “relief groove,” that runs laterally along the length of the body. The relief groove contains skin with no scales. Itallows for expansion, which helps plated lizards hide from predators. When threatened, they will run into a rocky hill and hide inside the crack of a rock. They then fill their lungs with air to wedge themselves in place.",The African plated lizard is among the largest in the plated lizard family and can grow to a maximum length of 70 centimeters (27.5 inches).,"African plated lizards are found in the northern stretch of the African subcontinent. The subspecies G. v. validus is seen in the eastern parts of this range, specifically in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Malawi. The subspecies G. v. maltzahni is found in central and southwest Namibia and in southern regions of Angola.
They live in mesic to arid habitats in the African savanna. They prefer the upper slopes of granite koppies (small hills that protrude from otherwise flat landscapes), and can often be found in the cracks of large rocks.",Not Evaluated,"When threatened, these lizards will hide inside the cracks of rocks and fill their lungs with air to wedge themselves in place.
Their eggs are large with leathery shells.",This animal is currently on exhibit
6, African pancake tortoise,Malacochersus tornieri,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Malacochersus tornieri,"Unlike most tortoises that have hard, domed shells, the African pancake tortoise has a thin, flat shell. As a result, the shell (or carapace) does not offer much protection from predators, so pancake tortoises use speed and flexibility to evade danger.
A pancake tortoise's shell is generally different shades of brown with patterns that provide camouflage in their rocky habitat. Its plastron, or belly, is pale yellow, and its head, limbs and tail are generally yellow-brown.",They grow to be about 7 inches (17.8 centimeters).,"African pancake tortoises are native to East Africa and are found in Kenya, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe.  They inhabit rocky outcrops, called kopjes, or rocky hills in arid thorn scrub and savannah regions. These habitats are generally 30 to 1,800 meters (100 to 6,000 feet) above sea level.
Pancake tortoises spend most of their time in crevices in the rocky hillsides. They are generally solitary, but crevices may be occupied by pairs or sometimes small groups.",Vulnerable,"Pancake tortoises have thin, flat shells.
They seem to get most of their water from the foods they eat.",This animal is not currently on exhibit
7, African clawed frog,Xenopus laevis,Amphibia,Anura,Pipidae,Xenopus laevis,"An African clawed frog's body is flattened with a smaller, wedge-shaped head. The positioning of the eyes and nostrils on the top of the head, along with camouflaged skin, help this species hide from predators, such as herons. The smooth skin is often multicolored with blotches of greenish-gray or brown on its back. The underside is off-white with a yellow hue. African clawed frogs have the ability to change their appearance to match their background, becoming darker, lighter or mottled.
The frogs' front limbs are small with non-webbed fingers used to push food into the mouth. Their hind legs are large and webbed, and the three inside toes on either foot have ""claws,"" which are not true claws but cornified tips. Although an adept swimmer, the African clawed frog is clumsy on land and crawls rather than hops.
African clawed frogs also have a lateral line system that is very sensitive to vibrations, enabling them to detect predators and prey in murky water. The lateral line is visible as a series of white stitch marks along each side of the frog.
The Pipidae family of frogs is unique in that members lack a tongue and a visible ear. The males also lack vocal cords. Instead of moveable eyelids, a horny, transparent covering protects their eyes.","Males weigh 2 ounces (60 grams), and are about 2 to 2.5 inches (5 to 6 centimeters) long. Females are much larger, weighing approximately 7 ounces (200 grams) and are about 4 to 4.5 inches (10 to 12 centimeters) long. Females also have cloacal extensions at the end of their abdomen.","These frogs live along the African Rift Valley south of the Sahara Desert in east and southern Africa, as well as in South Africa, Namibia and Angola. As an invasive species, they are now found in freshwater areas all over the world, including the United States, Chile, France, Indonesia, Portugal, United Kingdom and Italy. Rarely found in running streams, the African clawed frog prefers warm, stagnant pools and quiet streams, thriving in temperatures from 60 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Almost totally aquatic, it only leaves the water when forced to migrate to another pond. It is a highly opportunistic species and can easily colonize newly created water bodies.",Least concern,"At times, when its pond dries up, the African clawed frog can burrow in the mud and may lay dormant for up to a year.
The African clawed frog was the first vertebrate cloned in a laboratory.
Their skin produces a type of antibiotic that heals wounds rapidly, presumably a useful adaptation in the stagnant, microbe-filled waters where they live.",This animal is currently on exhibit
8, Addax,Addax nasomaculatus,Mammalia,Artiodactyla,Bovidae,Addax nasomaculatus,"Addax are stocky, sturdy antelopes with short, slender legs and short tails. The color of their coats varies based on the season; in the summer, their coats are white or very pale brown, while in the winter, their coats are gray, beige and even dark brown. Both males and females have short, shaggy manes, with dark patches between their long, twisted horns. They have white facial blazes that resemble an ‘x’ running between their eyes.","Adults weigh between 130-275 pounds (60-125 kilograms) and have a standing shoulder height of about 33 to 38 inches (85-95 centimeters). Females are typically a bit smaller than males. Their horns are long, reaching up to 28–33 inches (70–85 centimeters).","These animals are specially adapted to live in one of the harshest regions of the planet—the Sahara Desert. They can survive in dry, sandy deserts, as well as rocky hillsides, semi-arid grasslands and coastal plains.",Critically endangered,"Addaxes have wide, flat hooves that enable them to travel over sand more easily.
Their pale coats help reflect the sun’s rays, which keeps them cool in extreme heat.
Addaxes barely need to drink; they receive enough moisture to survive from the plants they eat.",This animal is not currently on exhibit
9, Abyssinian ground hornbill,Bucorvus abyssinicus,Aves,Coraciiformes,Bucorvidae,Bucorvus abyssinicus,"An Abyssinian hornbill's most obvious identifying feature is its large beak, topped with a bony prominence called a casque. However, they also boast striking features including long eyelashes, distinct facial markings, a yellow mark at the base of their beaks, and long legs that help them forage. Males sport blue and red coloration on their throats and blue around their eyes, while females only have blue on their eyes and throat. Males are also normally slightly larger than females. Juveniles have brown feathers and less vibrant throat coloration.
While they are able to fly, Abyssinian ground hornbills prefer to run if threatened. They will, however, fly to catch prey or defend territory.","Similar in size to a wild turkey, Abyssinian hornbills are large birds about 40 inches (102 centimeters) long and weighing up to 8 to 11 pounds (4 to 5 kilograms).","Abyssinian ground hornbills span the width of north-central Africa from Senegal and Guinea on the western coast to Ethiopia on the eastern coast. Primarily a terrestrial bird, Abyssinian ground hornbills live across the savanna, in grasslands and sub-desert scrub, as well as rocky areas. They have to have a tree in their habitat to nest.",Vulnerable,"The noticeable ""eyelashes"" of Abyssinian ground hornbills are actually modified feathers that protect their eyes from injury.

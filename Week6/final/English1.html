I argue play has an essential and productive role in our experience reading comics, and yet the visual and narrative tools provided by 20th-century comics were used in personalized ways shaped by individual contexts. Drawing from original archival research, this project seeks to answer two sets of questions: (1) How did comics create opportunities for play, and how did they imagine readers would respond to their invitations? (2) How did readers actually play with comics, and how did material, social, cultural, and historical contexts shape that play?
	In "Playing with Comics," play is defined through the intertwined processes of imagining oneself and others through printed content and the interpretation of those materials within personal contexts. Inspired by Rebecca Wanzo's work in The Content of Our Caricature (2020), I argue that the character types in comics provided one of the primary tools for play, and comics' invitations were defined through the visual logic of two distinct yet interconnected types: the idealized caricature and the undesirable stereotype. These character types served as models for readers' play, and my analyses investigate how idealized caricatures functioned as models for imitation and encouraged readers to imagine their own transformations while undesirable stereotypes restricted opportunities for play and reinforced racial, ethnic, and gendered stereotypes. The visual markers of identity and their associated narratives were reinforced through mechanical and ideological reproduction, but character types also relied on those readers  who played with and within these types.

This dissertation, titled Cartographics: Comics, Maps, and Storytelling, examines how comics and maps organize visual information by graphically charting it onto the space of the page, making them both effective when representing space, time, and narratives. As comics studies increasingly turns to expanding the definition of what comics can be, and geography studies increasingly turn to popular and accessible geographic and cartographic public-facing work, my dissertation project adds to this evolving discourse by analyzing how maps can be used within comics to bridge their historical (high art/low art; objective/subjective) and formal (supposed) disparities. I reimagine the boundaries of what comics and maps are and can be. I propose cartographics as an approach to the entanglement and assonances between comics and maps as storytelling mediums that graphically represent spatial and temporal relationships.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">Knowledge-Making in Early Modern Englishwomen's Literary Writings, 1570-1650 investigates early modern Englishwomen's exploration of scientific ideas and epistemological inquiries in several literary forms, arguing that their chosen literary conventions significantly influenced their epistemic exploration of science, and vice versa. The literary works of Englishwomen writers, rich with valuable scientific insights, have often been neglected in the field, and their contributions have yet to be fully integrated into the canon of English scientific history. In this dissertation, I rectify the historical oversight regarding Englishwomen's contributions by demonstrating their active participation in scientific and epistemological thinking of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries through their literary productions. This dissertation analyzes four literary works from the 1570s to the 1650s: Isabella Whitney's anthology A Sweet Nosegay (1573), Elizabeth Cary's closet drama The Tragedy of Mariam (1613), Lady Mary Wroth's prose romance The Countess of Montgomery's Urania (1621), and Hester Pulter's poetry collection Poems Breathed Forth by the Noble Hadassa (1640s-50s). I trace how these women writers deployed and reshaped epistemological inquiry to suit their creative endeavors, which reveals that literary forms served as vehicles for their investigation of scientific epistemologies, actively contributing to the scientific conversations of their time. Women writers critiqued, reinterpreted, and navigated theoretical knowledge, demonstrating a dynamic intersection between science, literature, and cultural narrative. In this way, literary forms provided these women with the means to question and reshape prevailing knowledge systems, offering diverse perspectives that are essential for fully historicizing women's knowledge-making in the early modern period.

The current spatial- temporal “here and now” is understood, in this dissertation, as the capitalist realism defined by Mark Fisher. Meanwhile, Gloria Anzaldua invites us to think about the consciousness that privileges indigenous ways of knowing and being, while recognizing the ways colonial logic has imprinted itself on our minds, bodies, communities, and spirits through mestiza consciousness and Nepantla. Bringing these two thinkers with me—my late queer, Latinx elders—I enter posthumanist, indigenous, and queer ecological discourse with Karen Barad, Donna Haraway, and Robin Wall Kimmerer. Munoz sees queerness as a practice of becoming, and I approach indigeneity in a similar way, focusing on agency rather than a neoliberal or colonial understanding of it through the language of the colonizer. Barad's conceptualization of agential realism offers a way to understand indigeneity beyond anthropocentrism, emphasizing the relationality between people and their ecosystems. This framework highlights how indigeneity is an active, reciprocal process shaped by our connections with the natural world. The goal of this project is to call for hope, a hope that requires discipline, imagination, and care. I aim to inspire some material action regarding land stewardship and the #LandBack movement by addressing Kimmerer's call for re-story-ation through literary analysis.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">In 2008, Hollywood identified a (relatively) new storytelling strategy that I call the elegiac sequel. These kinds of films appear at least ten years after the prior entry in the franchise or series, and feature a returning cast member, usually a star who has maintained popularity in the time between films. I argue that these elegiac sequels allow filmmakers and audiences opportunities to revisit the past both within the storyworld and in the real world, using the gap between entries as a way of thinking through how the past has influenced the present. 
 
In the course of my dissertation, I write about the pre-history of the elegiac sequel starting with The Sin of Harold Diddlebock in 1947 and moving up through the start of the elegiac boom period in 2008 with the release of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. In this chapter I examine the industrial crises points at which these nostalgic films look to the past for answers about an uncertain present in Hollywood as it comes under threat from TV, cable, and streaming services, among others. The next chapter is an investigation of how elegiac sequel trailers (and, by extension, the films themselves) serve two audiences and create a heightened sense of emotional response from the core features of the elegiac sequel, namely their genre reinventions, story extensions, and the revivals of stars in beloved character roles. By studying the intensified form of the trailer, I highlight the pleasures audiences can derive from elegiac sequels in their full-length forms.

Finally, my last chapter concerns the ways certain fans respond to elegiac sequels that modernize the ideas, themes, and casts with more diverse characters and actors being centered in roles that were primarily held by straight white cis men. I use the three Star Wars elegiac sequel films, The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, and The Rise of Skywalker, to examine how some people who did not enjoy the first two films in the trilogy alongside con (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

This economic development is focused on the region's natural environment and labor history in the aftermath of a post-extractive mining economy. The LCBD microregion is generally defined as the historic Hocking Valley Coal Mining region in Perry, Hocking, Athens, and Morgan counties. The name, Little Cities of Black Diamonds, refers to the history of coal mining in the region. After extractive industries in the region declined, the Wayne National Forest took its place, though there are still remnants of acid mine drainage, stories of underground coal pit fires that still burn today, and historical landmarks, like Robinson's Cave where the United Coal Miners Union formed, that inform the place-based identities in the region. 

This dissertation asks the following questions: How do diverse stakeholders negotiate a shared, though sometimes conflicting, interest in place? How is power negotiated within and beyond grassroots organizations? How do different generations approach place-making? What role does technical and professional communication play in grassroots place-making efforts? What is at stake in place-making efforts in rural areas that have a history of resource extraction? 
To explore these questions, I engage in rhetorical field methods and analyze texts ranging from archival documents, technical and professional documents, speeches, public-facing websites, and interviews. I look to the rhetorical practices of place-making that exist within grassroots coalitional networks, individual nonprofits, and between nonprofit and for-profit organizations. My dissertation posits that technical communication acts as an essential element in crafting shared narratives of place/environment, history, and community that circulate from the underground and intergenerational (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

Thus, a study of utopia best suits an interdisciplinary approach. While utopian scholars have often accepted the invitation for diverse approaches, there is one unifying aspect of the three aspects of utopia yet considered. In this dissertation, I posit a theory of utopian and dystopian rhetoric which explains the affective, persuasive dimension of each of utopia's aspects. 
Although I propose a wider application of utopian and dystopian rhetoric, I narrow my focus in this dissertation to investigate the connections between utopianism and eugenics. I analyze how nineteenth-century eugenicists leverage utopian and dystopian rhetoric to promote eugenic practices and beliefs. I argue that the hierarchy of eugenics and utopia – the privileging of certain populations and rejection of others as being suited for the future – are assured and enforced through ideological and repressive state apparatuses.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

The research is premised on my observation that analyses of black internationalism often bifurcate into these binary opposite arguments: it is either interpreted through the lens of antagonism, which privileges intra-racial discords between Africans and African Americans, or it is read through the lens of coalition, in which case emphasis is laid on the networks of collaboration between the two groups. My project, however, argues that these two interpretive lenses are not mutually exclusive but rather co-constitutive of the praxis of black internationalism since the mid-twentieth century. This dissertation, therefore, proposes what I call “Fractured Solidarities” as a conceptual framework for thinking through the project of global black solidarities that acknowledges the co-constitutive nature of coalition and contention in the make-up of transatlantic racial solidarity. Drawing on a variety of methodological approaches that cut across literary close-reading, archival research, film studies, digital humanities, and visual culture, this dissertation analyzes various genres and forms of cultural texts including fiction, poetry, non-fiction, film, and social media texts. This project intervenes in the scholarship on black internationalism by highlighting how the digital culture of the present moment has reshaped transnational black political activism and the praxis of social justice movements. Also, it contributes to the extensive scholarly conversation about Pan-Africanism by considering the ways in which less explored sources such as speculative fiction and social media open new vistas of interpretation for transatlantic solidarity between Africans and African Americans.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

Using The Blair Witch Project (1999) motion picture as an example text, case study, and vehicle for this exploration, this project engages with historical folkloristic discourses of authenticity, extant taxonomies of legendry and legend performance contexts, and the novel category of the “folkloresque” system of folkloric popular culture allusion.  These domains are examined in order to reimagine an allegedly “fake” legend complex (the marketing campaign surrounding The Blair Witch Project's initial premiere) as nevertheless engaged in certain critical contexts of folkloresque legend performance – namely, process and participation. These contexts, this project ultimately argues, serve in part as public platforms through which the generic boundaries of “fake” legend texts (like The Blair Witch Project) are generically reinforced or renegotiated by emic interlocutors through a pronounced reliance on commensurately folkloric rhetoric, performances, and other processes.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">This dissertation, Examining Programmatic Practices of First-Year Writing at Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), focuses on the various ways writing programs at HSIs and emerging HSIs (eHSIs) serve and support their minoritized student populations. Because federal law (Higher Education Opportunity Act, 2008) defines HSIs based on enrollment percentages alone, writing program administrators (WPAs) can experience challenges when seeking to enact policies and practices with an explicit aim to serve and support their students. The scholarship of writing studies at HSIs has typically examined what it means to serve students at the classroom level (Baca, Hinojosa, and Wolff Murphy, 2019; Kirklighter, Cardenas, and Wolff Murphy, 2007); however, my research focuses on what servingness means at the programmatic level through various practices that WPAs employ across their programs. 

Using a mixed-methods approach such as an Explanatory Sequential Mixed Methods Design (Creswell &amp; Creswell, 2018), I conducted an analysis of archival materials, recent surveys from 98 WPAs from HSIs and eHSIs across the country, and 42 one-on-one semi-structured interviews. I present research-driven narratives of writing program administrators (WPAs) who discuss existing program-level practices related to placement procedures, program goals, culturally relevant and sustaining curricula and instruction (Paris &amp; Alim, 2017), instructor training activities, and program assessment structures in the context of their HSI or eHSI designation. Overall findings reveal that possessing an HSI or eHSI designation does not mean that a first-year writing program supports students equitably and inclusively. It is up to the individual choices and leadership decisions that administrators make to make meaning of their designation and take action through program-level practices. With the ongoing shifts of student demographics in higher education and with more students entering such institutions, I expand upon (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">The history of imperialism in the Americas is one that entwines colonial interests with carceral power. Marginalized populations are dehumanized, displaced, and subjected to different forms of incarceration to secure political, economic, and cultural aims. This dissertation examines the role of rhetoric and literacy in the long historiographic arc of carceral-colonialism's development. From the new world turn, when European settler colonialism first took root in the Caribbean, to the transatlantic slave trade in the centuries that followed, I argue that carceral-colonial power was historically exercised by systematically denying the rhetoricity of dehumanized populations. At the core of my analysis is my theory of rhetorical debility, which describes the relationship between rhetoricity and the subjugation of populations marginalized by settler colonization, labor exploitation, and national security.

Taking up contemporary questions in rhetorical studies surrounding new materialism, posthumanism, and marginalized global rhetorical traditions, this dissertation puts forward a series of Critical Discourse Analysis-based case studies and comparative rhetorical analyses of carceral-colonialism's rhetorical historiography. I find that humanity has historically been defined and contested according to perceived capacities of rhetoricity – of practicing rhetoric and being rhetorical in ways that suit dominant social, economic, and political interests.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

Noting how today's digital rhetorical situation is largely adversarial, this dissertation points to the hacker as an exemplar of metic rhetorics. Through three case studies, each focusing on a different type of computer hack, this dissertation explores how the hacker subjectivity is produced and describes its beneficial lines of flight, discusses the interplay of metaphor and physicality in digital activism and cyberwar, and shows how metic rhetorical practices can be leveraged to create a safer and more just world and thus improve personal and organizational cybersecurity.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

This project uses contemporary speculative fiction from around the world to demonstrate that this sociopolitical critique can take place via modeling social relations. In chapters on capitalism, climate change, and forced migration, speculative fiction is shown to use “affective communities,” or small groups of people experiencing shared affective atmospheres, to not only critique crisis situations, but to suggest potential avenues out of them. This project departs from other speculative fiction critique in focusing not on the novum but on the characters' interactions with and attitudes toward the novum and larger fictional world, and especially on how the characters' treatment of one another comprises the majority of the effective intervention in fictional crisis. This approach is analyzed as a potential strategy for encouraging real-world change and political solidarity.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">Classroom-based simulations act as both reflections and deflections of reality. Nonetheless, their purpose is to enculturate students into a professional community through an experiential learning activity that asks students to adopt the mindset, mannerisms, and expertise of a professional. As such, students are molded into professionals through these experiences, and once they enter the workplace, they take part in shaping it, helping to subsequently craft the reality mirrored in future simulations. In other words, simulations create a feedback loop between the simulation and reality, each always shaping and reflecting a version of each other. Because of this, instructors and researchers need to take seriously not only the pedagogical implications of simulations, but also the sociopolitical.  

Guided by the methodological approach of abductive analysis (Tavory &amp; Timmermans, 2014), this dissertation, through a mixed-methods case study of the pseudonymous Simulation for Raising Interprofessional Aptitude (STRIA) Program, examines how interprofessional healthcare students—social work students, in particular—are trained, through simulation, to provide patient-centered care in a simulated hospital setting. 

Specifically, building upon rhetorical theory, technical and professional communication, and critical disability studies, this study asks: How do interprofessional healthcare students work across divisions (in knowledge, experience, and language), together and with patients, to enact patient-centered care? How can rhetorical theory be put into practice to help interprofessional healthcare students prepare for working in unpredictable environments? How might pre-professional healthcare training, specifically simulation-based learning, respond to humanistic critiques about the efficacy and ethics of simulations? And what can rhetoricians learn from conducting in-situ research in complex workplace simulations?

fiction, science fiction, and zines, in English or translated into English, might help us to
open new avenues of transformation by working through the past and imagining
alternative futures. Referencing scholars and activists in queer, transformative, and
disability justice, Postcolonial Studies, and Hong Kong Studies, my dissertation adds new
materials from the Hong Kong context to enrich the discussions of affect that have
hitherto mostly focused on Western societies. It also employs affect as a heuristic device
to re-examine the rampant neoliberalizing process and its dire consequences. Diverse and
divergent as the materials for analysis are, they are all organized around an investigation
into the collusional connection between the biopolitical regulation of populations and the
manipulation of affective potentials that upholds and sustains the transnational neoliberal
system. While foregrounding key concepts of decoloniality and affect from a range of
interdisciplinary approaches, my project probes deeply into the question of what
imaginations are intentionally denied, foreclosing possibilities of hope and change. The
central questions that my study intends to answer are: How can literature and other
cultural products created by Hong Kong writers and artists construct the foundation of a
liberating aesthetic that reflects a capacity to imagine alternative worlds? And what are
the conditions in which new forms of livability, sociality, and futurity can emerge,
survive, and flourish? My project seeks to contribute to anticolonial traditions and
decolonial thought. While grounded in literary and textual analysis, my research thinks
with people's everyday practices under conditions of political and economic duress in
imaginative and hopeful ways. Modelling the cross-disciplinary, cross-border work

An example explains the genesis of this project - the Netflix television series, “Squid Game.” This text is unabashedly anti-capitalist, and was celebrated by a broad audience and by Hollywood's award system, seized by audiences both popularly (viewership) and canonically (awards).  The goal of this project is to examine exemplary texts of this trend, and consider what they (and their producers) communicate in terms of radical politics. My methodological approach draws from popular culture studies, narrative theory (rhetorical narratology), Marxist criticism and critical theory. My guiding question is, if these texts are so popular, why have we not had revolution in the streets? 
	The answer – and core concept of my project – is recuperation, the process through which capitalism absorbs, nullifies and even commodifies radical discourse, regardless of its form, and turns it into something that reenergizes capitalism itself. In other words, In the post-2008 pop culture landscape, audience desire to explore the end of capitalism has been met by the pop culture industry with efforts to shore up capitalism under the guise of anti-capitalism. What audiences want and believe they are getting is in fact the very opposite.
	Much of this paradox has to do with what I'm calling the supranarrative, the non-academic discourse related to narratives that circulates in mass media – reviews, thinkpieces, news stories, celebrity interviews, etc. We make sense of the world around us through the stories we tell, so when we are confronted with narratives that are incongruous – stories that suggest an end to capitalism, against a reality where that end seems impossible – we engage in discourse around them as we struggle to make sense of this discrepancy. The role of the supranarrative is often to act as a framework for engaging with this discrepan (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">This dissertation probes into three contemporary fictional stories about dementia, two of which are not traditionally seen as examples of the genre of “illness narratives.” The first of these two (Edwidge Danticat's “Sunrise/Sunset”) is an intergenerational story about a mother and daughter pair, and the second (Alice Munro's “The Bear Came over the Mountain) is a redemption story of a husband whose wife becomes afflicted with dementia. The third story, Lisa Genova's Still Alice is a proper “dementia narrative,” but previous discussions of it have focused on its representation of the progress of Alice's dementia rather than on her exercise of agency. By analyzing the three primary texts in a fashion of literary analysis, I not only contend that narrative resources of focalization, progression, and intersubjectivity can be employed to make moving stories about illnesses such as dementia but demonstrate they can also serve as resources for dementia narrative identities' (re)formation during the illness's progress, with or without the help of other agents. By highlighting the insights into dementia identity offered by these stories—and by literary fiction more generally—this study can benefit specific groups of actual audiences such as professional and family caregivers, patient advocates, and narrative medicine scholars. In this way, the study can enrich critical conversations about dementia within the medical humanities, whether those conversations focus on its nature, its treatment, or its effects on caregivers and loved ones.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">This project focuses on historical and contemporary print cultures of the Ozarks, highlighting the vernacular dimensions of print and its connection with ideas of place and history. Rather than centering popular publications with broad circulation, I take a folkloristic approach to investigate how people collect and share information, news, traditions, and knowledge through everyday genres of print. The three primary case studies examined here include regional folk magazines from the mid-twentieth century, the newsletters of a lesbian social club at the century's end, and the digitized newspaper of a small Missouri town from a hundred years in the past. Each case study brings together scholarship from folklore and print culture studies, symbolized through the application of a conceptual pair tied to each discipline: region and assemblage; genre and network; and, finally, performance and news. By exploring the conceptual pair within each case study, I demonstrate how an interdisciplinary dialogue can address the connections between print technologies and local traditions. Tracing the ongoing remediation of oral tradition and older media genres and technologies, I uncover cross-temporal layering in the experience of rural regionality. 

At stake in this investigation of rural print culture is the concept of regionality: how mobile and dispersed place-based networks of access, resources, and communication are actualized and sustained. The study of rural print culture can help us better understand the ways in which people make use of print, both as a technology and as a modality tied to history and tradition, to envision and negotiate regional narratives in creative and unexpected ways.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">The title of this dissertation, The Problems of Leisure in the Industrial-Era US, riffs on a phrase that became common amongst American academics in the 1970s: “the problem of leisure.” For the industrial-era American bourgeoisie, however, leisure wasn't a problem but many problems. The crystallization of leisure in its modern form—clearly defined, regularly recurring, and commercially exploitable periods of free time—created a host of fears and desires that, in turn, precipitated many different responses, including the two that I examine in this project: mid-nineteenth-century liberal efforts to control working-class uses of leisure time by “improving” working-class tastes, and the later efforts of modernists to distinguish their own uses of leisure from the purportedly more commercialized and degraded leisure practices of others, especially other within the middle class. 
The former efforts were spearheaded by William Ellery Channing, whose gospel of culture did two critical things. First, it insisted that culture, which Channing defined as the development of our God-given powers, required spiritual, as opposed to economic, forms of wealth. This argument helped to neutralize what I claim was the anti-capitalist potential of culture, the way it, more so than the older bourgeois conception of legitimate leisure (recreation), had the capacity to inspire a critique of the division of labor and of industrial capitalism more generally. Second, Channing's gospel posited the spread of “the means of culture” (“Self-Culture” 22)—in the forms of parks, picture galleries, lectures, and other publically provisioned, non-commercial forms of leisure—as the most effective solution to the amusement problem, the problem of working-class people consuming commercialized forms of pleasure that social reformers deemed morally degrading and socially disruptive.

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">This dissertation diagnoses and analyzes a unique feature of seriality—the repetition or subversion of some specific formal pattern or norm in a way that is apparent only to those who are attentive to the serial's formal operations. I call these “Aha!” moments and argue that they are one of the key ways that a serial simultaneously rewards its most devoted fans for their past attention, while also implicitly urging them to continue those same behaviors. Thus, when a serial repeatedly provides “Aha!” moments, it creates a self-perpetuating feedback loop that draws fans back for repeated and ever-more invested consumption of the serial. I examine these “Aha!” moments by combining close readings of the formal structures and systems that produce them with analysis of the affective response they generate in audiences, with particular attention to how they are discussed in both critical and popular discourse. Focusing specifically on serial film and television, I argue for the validity of studying the two mediums alongside each other on the grounds that the shared formal features of their respective visual narrational practices give rise to similar repetitive patterns. The case studies featured throughout have been selected to offer a wide range of different types of “Aha!” moments, both in terms of the formal characteristics that produce them and also the interpretive significance they carry, and I attend to both of these considerations throughout. It is only in recent years that “Aha!” moments have been a common feature of serials, although my case studies do feature several examples of earlier ones. I argue that the “Aha!” moment's surge since the 1990s is tied to corporate consolidation in media industries, and especially to the rise of digital technologies. The ease with which contemporary audiences can maintain a library of a serial's history, as opposed to the comparative scarcity of specific media texts before home video, DVD box sets, and streaming services, allo (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">This project examines the relationship between music and literary modernism, arguing that modernist authors invoke music in their novels to critique and to imagine more equitable social structures. Using Theodor Adorno's theories on music's ability to model inclusive social structures through balanced part/whole, or detail/totality, relationships, I consider both formal and thematic musical connections in modernist novels. If, as Adorno argues, musical form can reflect current social structures and offer models for more equitable ones, then the modernist use of music can be understood as an attempt to critique social hierarchies and to imagine a more equitable future.
My first chapter examines the works of E.M. Forster and his use of music in Howards End and A Passage to India. An extended engagement with Beethoven's Fifth Symphony and a brief reference to Indian raga allow Forster to consider issues of race, gender, and class through a musical lens. Through these musical references, Forster opens up possibilities for legibility of the individual within the whole. Ultimately, however, the individual is negated by the patriarchal and imperial whole. The second chapter turns to Virginia Woolf's late novels, The Years and Between the Acts, to argue that Woolf explores an expansive and democratic view of what constitutes music in an effort to undermine fascist communication. In my third chapter, I consider Trinidadian literature and its connection to calypso form. Using Sam Selvon's The Lonely Londoners and V.S. Naipaul's Miguel Street, I argue that the interactive and political aspects of calypso form, employed by Selvon and Naipaul in the ballad construction of their novels, allows for critique of the imperial power while offering alternatives to imperial narratives. Considering these author's engagements with music alongside Adorno's theories on equitable part/whole relationships in music, this project offers a new way to understand how music functions in modernist  (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">Pain Management in Nineteenth-Century American Literature explores how three writers, Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, and Charles Chesnutt, imagine and theorize pain and pain relief during a period of burgeoning medical and political upheaval in the nineteenth-century United States. To situate these writers within their historic moment, I trace a trajectory of the cultural and medical attitudes toward pain. In theorizing human suffering, each of these three writers actively revises the cartesian division between the body and mind that still persists in writing about pain today, as demonstrated by the dominance of Elaine Scarry's 1985 argument that pain actively destroys language. This dissertation fundamentally revises Scarry's claim by illustrating how literature from my three case studies works to redefine the relationship between the phenomenology of pain and each writer's respective representational projects. Overall, I offer a way out of Scarry's insistence on the inexpressibility of pain and embrace these authors' success in rendering pain and in fashioning literary strategies for pain management and relief. For Dickinson, I situate her poetics of the sublime within the context of the newly developed technology of anesthesia. I argue that Dickinson portrays sublime encounters with art as analogous to the pain relief provided by anesthesia, which demonstrates her poetry's ability to oscillate between metaphorical and literal pain management methods. To the field of Whitman studies, I provide a new investigation of Whitman's rendering of soldiers' pain through a cluster of his earliest  Civil War poems. These poems, I argue, demonstrate Whitman's attempt to find the most precise language possible to depict the immediacy and immanence of soldiers' pain. In my third chapter, I contribute a new way of reading Charles Chesnutt's Uncle Julius tales, in which Chesnutt demonstrates how the act of storytelling is similar to Black conjure magic in its ability to help miti (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">Afrophantasm is both a rhetorical framework and a lens considering how the invisibility of black disability can be used and understood in both positive and/or negative ways. As a reconsideration of W.E.B. Du Bois's seminal idea of double conscious “two-ness” in The Souls of Black Folk, Afrophantasm instead represents a “threeness” by positioning a person's self-state in a trifecta of Blackness, American status, and embodiment through the lens of ability. Further, it theorizes how an environment can produce or amplify a black disabled spectral state created through stigma and ignorance, either by erasing the acknowledgment of this multi-marginalization or refocusing it to leverage its perceived disadvantages into a state of empowerment or self-recognition. By considering the idea of the rhetorical in relation to this theory, its application is expanded through a variety of examples, including cultural rhetoric (via nommo or West African oral stylistic practice), visual rhetoric (and the question of photographic disabled representations), as well as in embodied rhetoric (through the interrogation of black genetics or cybernetics), to name a few. 
When he coined Afrofuturism in 1993, Mark Dery wrote that "African Americans…inhabit a sci-fi nightmare in which unseen but no less impassable force fields of intolerance frustrate their movements; official histories undo what has been done; and technology is too often brought to bear on black bodies" (181). Through a complex nexus of art, music, literature, and more, the genre exists as a universe progressively centered on black lives and experiences juxtaposed against a world built to erase them. Yet, when it comes to the subaltern realm of Blackness and disability woven together, those most in need of a reprieve are instead assaulted with a litany of new shiny digital tools of discrimination, as the famed “digital divide” (highlighting an assumed lesser black digital literacy vs. white internet competence) turns corporeal (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

Specifically, it examines the potential for one integral, yet largely unaddressed pedagogical site for furthering such goals: grammar instruction. Through a two-stage, mixed methods study, I first analyze generalizable trends in contemporary grammar pedagogy and training practices through a national survey. I second evaluate receptivity to and potentials for developing and circulating anti-racist, liberatory grammar curriculum and training through a college-wide case study. Overall, my project seeks to examine the ways that Composition instructors and writing program administrators might understand, develop, and circulate grammar pedagogies in ways consistent with contemporary disciplinary ideologies on languaging.

After articulating the exigency for the project in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 reports on a nationwide survey that was completed by over 130 Composition instructors across the U.S. on their grammar pedagogy training, attitudes, perspectives, goals, and practices. Out of findings that revealed the presence of both historically established pedagogies and an emergent, grassroots grammar pedagogy responsive to anti-racist perspectives, this chapter proffers an ideological framework for categorizing and understanding grammar pedagogies. This frames Stage Two of the project, which applies the framework as an administrative and analytical tool for localized curriculum development and training. 

Chapter 3 situates Stage Two's case study, which was a collaborative project between me and Linn-Benton Community College English faculty member Dionisia Morales. Chapter 4 discusses the results of our Feminist Writing Program Administration and critically pedagogies-based participatory action research, which supported Morales' project by surveying over 200 students, faculty, and staff, conducting 14 indi (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">Social Mediated Latinas: Creating and Contouring Digital Latina Looks in the Twenty-First Century documents how new forms of Latina celebrity, media viewership, and cultural critique emerged in the twenty-first century with the onset of entertainment streaming platforms, online subcultures, and the social media influencer industry on the internet. Latinas with internet access used their social media presence to create original content and to participate in conversations related to media representation's impacts on Latina identity in the United States. They utilize the participatory affordances of various digital platforms—such as hashtags, direct messaging, and video editor studios—to post to their personal social media accounts and interact with other users' content online. In doing so, Latinas act as cultural producers whose online activity builds on existing mass media depictions of Latinas while simultaneously interrogating the star marketing strategies, beauty standards, and stereotyped narratives that U.S. legacy media industries have projected onto them.

This project uses a combined approach of content, reception, production, and star persona analysis to examine the social media posts related to Latina representation that are produced, viewed, and responded to by U.S.-based Latina cultural producers on the internet. I recognize the 2010s to be the decade when many Latinas utilized the media production and social networking capabilities of sites like YouTube and TikTok to transform themselves into what I define as Social Mediated Latinas: creators of digital content who, in their self-reflexive posts and public discourse, emphasize their ethnoracial identity as an integral part of how they make, view, and critique Latina representation. I survey how three types of Social Mediated Latinas—Internet celebrities, traditional celebrities, and comics creators—foreground their ethnoracial identity on the internet in ways that complicate the legacies of Latina star (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">The makers of commercial popular culture often incorporate folklore into their works. Although their definition of folklore is generally restricted to pre-modern narratives and beliefs that form only a small part of what folklore is, their works relate to traditional content in a more expansive way. This dissertation examines a contemporary television genre that not only incorporates traditional content but, I argue, functions as folklore in its own right by negotiating truth and belief, constructing social Others, and, at the meta-level, constituting an archive. 

Since the 1990s, serial narratives in which everyday people investigate and solve supernatural disturbances in a procedural format have become a mainstay of North American television and streaming media. Such programs, including The X-Files and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, have generally lacked a cohesive genre designation. I argue for “supernatural procedural” as the genre's preferred term and trace its history from predecessors in Victorian-era occult detective fiction to early forms in 1970s television, through solidification in the 1990s into its current permutations. I outline conventions that include, among others, realistic worldbuilding, a blend of episodic and serial storytelling, and, notably, a tendency to engage with folklore. Employing an approach blending folkloristics and popular culture studies, I argue that specific characteristics of the supernatural procedural allow series to function as televisual folklore: folklore not just adapted by, but actually occurring within the television medium. This emphasis contributes to newer avenues in folklore studies, which has only recently begun seriously analyzing television, and popular culture studies, where folkloristic perspectives are often overlooked.

This work considers the abovementioned series at length alongside subsequent programs like Supernatural and Grimm, using supporting analysis from Lucifer, Evil, SurrealEstate, and Wellington Pa (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">Interaction between patients and healthcare clinicians comprise a central aspect of American medical practice. This feature of medicine—patient-clinician communication—has received attention from various fields of study that aim to improve communication between these parties. One oft-cited aspect of this communication is the imbalance in authority that favors clinicians over patients; policies such as patient-centered care and shared decision-making have been advocated for as ways to balance these relationships. This dissertation takes up this asymmetry and identifies the ways in which patients and clinicians negotiate their authority in the course of interaction. Bringing together diverse data sets, Constructing Empowerment: Epistemic and Deontic Authority in Patient-Centered Care Interactions delineates ways that patients and clinicians negotiate authority while working to achieve patient-centered care.

	The data sets range from recordings between actual patients and their primary care clinicians to focus groups gathered with practicing physicians, current policy documents, and a fictional medical drama. Each chapter identifies key linguistic features that play a role in the negotiation of authority that patients and clinicians are engaged in as a part of medical practice. Starting with an extended analysis of one interaction between a patient and clinician, subsequent chapters expand the context to include the ways that institutional and cultural constraints shape and are shaped by these interactions. Chapter one demonstrates the role discourse markers and imperatives play to manage competing territories of knowledge and create empowering positions. Chapter two focuses on the ways that issues regarding health insurance emerge in the course of patient-clinician interaction; here, health insurance itself is seen to provide an additional set of assumptions that lie outside of traditional notions of what patients and clinicians are expected to know and functions t (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

Through an analysis of Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde (c. 1380s), Thomas Malory's Le Morte Darthur (c. 1460s), and John Capgrave's The Life of St. Katherine (c. 1445), I demonstrate that the authors of these texts subvert reader expectations for medieval romance by depicting characters who are resistant to participation in the (hetero)sexual economy, and who therefore may be productively read as expressing an asexual perspective that has heretofore gone unacknowledged in scholarship on the genre. Because they refuse to consent to the sexual and marital relationships expected of them by readers and fellow characters alike, the protagonists of these texts disrupt the cultural ideologies that scholars often assume underpin the romance genre. Finally, I argue that Chaucer, Malory, and Capgrave all manipulate romance conventions in order to interrogate the role of consent in medieval religious thinking and social practice. By asserting that scholars must always read romance with a skeptical eye towards the necessary presence of normative sexuality, my dissertation aims to reveals the complexity and radical potential of the genre.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">This dissertation traces use of the atom as a poetic figure for exploring embodied experience in the work of three early modern women poets. Over the course of the seventeenth century, the Scientific Revolution incarnated a reconceptualization of the world and humans' place within it. Men like Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, William Harvey, Isaac Newton, and Rene Descartes advocated for an experimental approach to scientific work that ultimately resulted in a worldview that legitimated human exploitation of nature in pursuit of knowledge. By the end of the century, England's intellectual elite imagined the world as a machine — mechanistic, inert, available to be mined for knowledge. However, the atomic poetry of Margaret Cavendish, Hester Pulter, and Lucy Hutchinson, the three writers considered in this dissertation, suggests an alternate history for poetic materialism that's been overlooked by previous scholars. In linking Cavendish, Pulter, and Hutchinson, and the atomic renaissance of the mid-seventeenth century, with the ancient materialisms they inherited and the modern feminist materialisms they prefigure, I argue their work should be read as a chapter within a long-unfolding story about the relationships of human beings with and as Nature. This dissertation treats early modern poetry as both literature and philosophy, taking seriously the epistemologies and ontologies embedded within these women writers' poetic works. In so doing, it contributes to ongoing efforts to broaden the canon. It does so by offering a series of close readings that attend to both the literary value of and the philosophical theories embedded within early modern women writers' atomic poetry, drawing on methods from new feminist formalism, feminist and queer theories, and the history of science. At the same time, I consider this poetry through the lens of theories offered by feminist materialism and related fields, including ecofeminism and queer temporality.

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">My dissertation brings together two popular pastimes of the late Middle Ages: dance and romance. I examine a group of Middle English poems that are influenced by the rich social life of late medieval England, c. 1385-1450: Osbern Bokenham's Legend of Holy Women, Thomas Chestre's Sir Launfal, John Lydgate's Troy Book and Siege of Thebes, Geoffrey Chaucer's Anelida and Arcite, and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. I argue that dance inspires new and innovative poetic experience as I explore how late-fourteenth and fifteenth-century poets use dance to experiment and play with descriptions of motion. 
	
 Dance was a popular subject in medieval romance. Romanciers created a rhetoric to describe dance and revelry. Rather than approach this rhetoric as simply generic and codified, I read these moments of dance as experimentations with the structural, formal, and rhetorical features of poetic descriptions of motion. These moments of experimentation are further illuminated by the mis-en-page of these passages in their manuscript witnesses. Middle English poets deployed a range of rhetorical strategies to translate dance's relationship with bodies, objects, and community into their poetic descriptions as they experiment with describing bodies in motion. In effect, these poets not only adopted but created an innovative rhetoric to choreograph descriptions of dance. </div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">Didacticism in Contemporary Illness Narratives: Dialogue, Subjectivity, Justice arises
from my observation of a surprising discrepancy: some of the most powerful contemporary
illness narratives have didactic purposes (that is, they seek to impart moral lessons), yet the
dominant theoretical approaches to illness narratives denigrate didacticism. In response to this
gap between practice and theory, my dissertation emphasizes practice as it explores how authors
from Audre Lorde to Philip Roth have made their didactic purposes integral to the power of their
narratives.
More specifically, my response to the gap provides an interpretive and a theoretical
intervention. At the interpretive level, the dissertation offers readings of several didactic illness
narratives across genres demonstrating how these texts offer valuable perspectives on illness. I
then build on these readings to call for a pluralization of methods used to understand illness
narratives in general and didactic illness narratives in particular. In other words, I address how
conversations about the nature and functions of illness narratives must change so as to account
for the appeal and effects of didactic ones.
Each chapter explores narratives that illuminate the titular themes: dialogue, subjectivity,
and justice. I read the narratives through the lens of rhetorical narrative theory, which asks how
authors mobilize resources to represent specific illness experiences and to engage audiences
affectively and ethically as their narratives elaborate and communicate a moral lesson. For
example, my chapter on justice focuses on The Cancer Journals by Audre Lorde examining how
she complicates the traditional authority of the cancer writer by imparting moral lessons that
require readers to understand cancer diagnoses as simultaneously an individual experience and
communal crises.

Many teacher-scholars have turned to principles of Learning Transfer as a solution for promoting student learning in the writing classroom. Learning transfer, the repurposing or generalization of knowledge between contexts, is an incredibly complex process. Discussions of transfer often lack critical attention to what prior knowledges, skills, dispositions, or literacies we expect students might bring into writing courses, as well as what we hope they will take with them. Writing studies scholarship needs a model that defines prior knowledges and transfer in ways that explicitly attend to sociocultural and linguistic diversity to establish practices for cultural accountability in teaching for writing transfer. To address this need, I designed a mixed-method study that was guided by four research questions:
1.	What prior knowledges, if any, do First-Year Writing instructors expect students to possess?
2.	To what degree do those expectations account for sociocultural and linguistic knowledges from home, school, and other contexts?
3.	How are students' prior knowledges valued or mobilized by instructors?
4.	What patterns, if any, exist across instructors' beliefs about teaching and learning, assumptions about student prior knowledges, and instructional practices?

Through a framework of writing studies transfer scholarship and asset-based, multicultural education pedagogies, my mixed-methods analysis of participating instructors' survey, interview, and teaching document data offers two contributions to writing studies and transfer scholarship. The first is a systematic Typology of Prior Knowledges, makes it possible to account for the various expectations instructors have about students' prior knowledges.

This study employs rhetorical theory—specifically rhetorical theories of publics and counterpublics to examine the networks and relationships between Black students and educational institutions as well as the ways political, economic, and social power marginalizes Black students and creates space for alternative discourses. This study's significance lies in the specific Black college student public writing it examines and the gap of studying Black college student public writing at predominantly White institutions.

To what degree does code help us think about and compose texts, and to what degree can we engage with it as a text itself? Guided by these framing questions, this dissertation lies at the nexus of digital humanities; rhetoric, writing, and composition; and teaching, learning and pedagogy. It engages coding as a fixation of the global information economy: a literacy that has joined reading and writing to constitute a foundation of “moral goodness and economic success” signaling “the health of a nation and its citizens” (Vee 3).

The larger argument of this dissertation is developed around the notion of seeing the code as a pedagogical framework for teaching and learning with code in the humanities. Scholars have begun to investigate how we can think about code and coding cultures vis-a-vis literacy studies, rhetoric, and the hermeneutical methodologies of the humanities. This dissertation extends the developing humanities framework for analyzing and composing with code into the larger discourse on teaching and learning with code. Just as the past few decades have seen the multimodal turn in writing and humanities pedagogy, this dissertation looks ahead to a coding turn that will just as much naturalize a peculiar medium of representation and agency as part of the teaching mission of our disciplines.

The overall goal of the dissertation is to construct a rigorous, multidimensional, and transdisciplinary ethos for digital humanities pedagogy—and code-focused pedagogy in particular—that draws from research and teaching in rhetoric, writing, and textual studies; the (digital) humanities broadly; education studies; and science and technology studies. Chapter one develops a vernacular theory of code by calling on a variety of phenomena and disciplines.

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">When a children's recital piece from the nineteenth century opens with the interrogation, “Well, Dolly, what are you saying, / When you blink and wink your eyes?” the implication is clear: the doll's silence speaks volumes. Articulating Dolls means to anatomize Dolly's cryptic body, to decipher dolls not just as articulated figures of parts but as articulated figures of speech. Dolls in the Victorian popular imagination are saying something, and this dissertation designs to find out what.

Speaking the Victorian pediolect that molded Woman like a statue, played her for a puppet, transacted her like a doll, or took her for a dummy (a sororal synonymy that contemporary Dolls Studies is only just beginning to elaborate), this project dissects the doll-inflected discourse framing femininity to anatomize how true womanhood was made to share the mold with ideal sculpture and other dolliform bodies of man-ufactured perfection. Following an introductory etiology that historicizes definitions of Pygmalionism--a paraphilia that to the Victorians inscribed a desire not for the simulated woman who comes alive but for the Gal(atea) who (re)turns to stone--chapter one emphasizes how the desire for women who were statues(que) compels their decease as the feminine form was sartorially and semiotically impressed into a fashion for mortification. Showing that the sculptural was intrinsically sepulchral, chapter two analyzes the intrinsically (nec)romantic idioms of dollification in Dickens's Our Mutual Friend. More expressly executed female bodies are the subject of chapter three, in which ventriloquial phonodolls are made of the morbid (and thus more biddable) “Venuses” in Du Maurier's Trilby and Villiers's The Future Eve. The still(ed) lifes of statues (non) vivants are the focus of Carroll's narrative photography in chapter four, while chapter five filters his Alice books through the author's “photographic memory” of a lost Liddell doll.

It employs an allegorical method of interpretation informed by syncretic-feminist theology to a collection of eighteenth-century Enlightenment literature to demonstrate how the satirical mode was used to push back against the bodily technologies of the medical profession. This project helps us to identify the characteristic features of these topical satires, which voice a deep epistemological discomfort with the principles, methods, and practices of the emergent secular medical field. Medical satires feature narrators and targets that elide the figures of the physician and the satirist as humoral healers, scientific methodologies applied to absurd and bawdy topics, and a considerable amount of human and animal suffering resulting from poorly-applied medical treatments. This dissertation then reads Laurence Sterne's The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy as a virtuosic representative of the medical satire subgenre whose narrator thoroughly foils both his own and a reader's attempt to rationalize and unify his creation and circumstance. This project hopes to offer literary and medical scholars an allegorical perspective into medicine's literary origins and entanglements to support the gradual recovery and revitalization of pre-Medical Enlightenment medical wisdom.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

This project argues that the production and reception of many recent novels are influenced by a range of forms and practices common in digital media, and that these influences have a profound impact on contemporary storytelling techniques. Through analyses of novels by Kate Atkinson, Salvador Plascencia, Steve Tomasula, and Mark Z. Danielewski, I consider how (sometimes subtle) shifts in authors' use of media is changing the way that the novel form operates, reflecting audiences' familiarity with new media even as the novel remains a vital literary form in the twenty-first century.

In order to study these issues, I introduce the new analytical category of the medial frame, a particular type of social frame used to identify and describe the conventionalized rules and expectations that readers apply to specific uses of media. Medial frames, developed from a diverse set of linguistic and phenomenological approaches, are defined as social contexts that pair technological materials with the wealth of conventions that govern how those materials are used as part of communicative acts. Medial frames can be employed as interpretive tools to analyze how a text's use of medial technologies (e.g., printed text, images and color, page layout, paratextual materials) prompts audiences to apply certain reception practices over others.

I show how medial frames are particularly suited to examining the complex medial environment of twenty-first-century storytelling, in which creators often use a diversity of technologies to communicate with audiences. The print novels of this era ask readers to adopt surprising medial frames, such that persuasive interpretations of these texts are only available to those who are prepared (whether implicitly or self-consciously) to adopt and adapt digital and (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">This dissertation argues that the microscope had a significantly broader impact on English literary writing than has previously been acknowledged. Critics interested in how microscopic technology and science during the nineteenth century influenced literary writers have examined the role the microscope played in the development of realism, particularly the realist aesthetic of George Eliot. In their almost exclusive focus on realism, however, these critics have overlooked how nineteenth-century writers other than Eliot working in genres other than literary realism made novelistic use of the microscope. From James Hogg and Charles Dickens to Oscar Wilde and Richard Marsh, my dissertation considers a wide range of English authors who published their most iconic literary works between 1820 and 1900, the historical period in which the microscope gradually rose to prominence in science as an indispensable tool of advanced scientific research. It argues both that the cultural fascination with the microscope during this time extended in numerous directions and the versatility of the instrument appealed to a heterogeneous group of literary figures. Adopting a historicist and cultural studies approach, my dissertation shows that Hogg, Dickens, Wilde, and Marsh shared a fundamental concern not only with problems of vision and observation but also with problems of disease and disease transmission, and turned to the microscope to most productively explore these complex issues in their fiction. Through a series of close readings, this dissertation aims to expand our critical understanding of the ways in which microscopy and microscopic science informed novelistic writing of the long nineteenth century.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">This dissertation examines the literary and cultural production of the national Emergency declared by Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi on June 25, 1975. I define “Postcolonial Exceptions” as the situation of recurring crises, dictatorships, and civil wars that plagued countries in the Global South during the decolonization era. I study multiple sites of discursive production: Indian fiction in English and translation, journalism, documentary films, and visual ephemera in the post-independence period to challenge readings of the Emergency as an isolated event, instead theorizing it as a crisis of liberalism and a formative moment in the rise of Hindu nationalism in India. 

	Scholarly investigation of the relationship between state and literature/culture has often relied on a rigid dichotomy between the implicit autonomy of artistic production and the demands of conformity from the monolithic state. Since the 1970s, human rights discourses have reproduced this dichotomy in considering postcolonial states and their relationship with dissident artists and authors. As opposed to this view, my dissertation puts forward a postcolonial framework that emphasizes the constitutive role of literary and cultural writing in producing the idea of the state and its ‘proper' subject. I argue that a reading of postcolonial literatures as the literature of exception makes space for the reconceptualization of cultural production as both sites of resistance and collusion with repressive states. Simultaneously, my project explores how ideas of ‘freedom' and ‘authoritarianism' reflected in the literature/culture of the Emergency speak to the Cold War intellectual politics of the 1970s and the decades that preceded it. 

Finally, “Postcolonial Exceptions” traces the Emergency's circulation as a political and narrative trope in contemporary India, demonstrating how various actors in India and abroad have narrativized the crisis in the interests of competing versions of the historica (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

The novels my dissertation focuses on, such as Dolen Perkins-Valdez's Wench (2010), Yxta Maya Murray's The Conquest (2002), and LeAnne Howe's Miko Kings: An Indian Baseball Story (2007), explore histories of American imperial violence and its impact on communities and networks of kin. These novels share a preoccupation with building community and finding kin—biological or chosen—to collaboratively author alternative historical narratives that counterbalance the often debilitating narratives empire has prescribed. The connections the protagonists of these novels forge and the stories they tell also act as restorative community building measures to redress the way state violences have separated, displaced, or otherwise impeded kinship. By focusing on the way these authors reframe kinship and community in the wake of empire's violence, my dissertation sheds light on how empire's reverberations are not only present in discussions of war and economics, but also in our relationships.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">No surviving medieval text puts forward an explicit theologia tangendi (a “theology of
touching”). Still, the religious literature of the English Middle Ages is nonetheless replete
with devotional acts of touching, reaching, grasping, holding, shaping, and caressing. Touch
may constitute one small facet of the phenomenology of religion, but it requires more
scholarly attention. That the literature and material culture of the Christian Middle Ages were
often oriented toward achieving contact with the divine underscores the need to consider the
theological implications of touch. This dissertation puts a name to these myriad, disconnected
references to touching that crop up across medieval English literature — a “tactile theology”
that acknowledges the centrality of the hands in medieval texts, the lives of those texts, and
the lives of their writers and readers. Put simply, tactile theology is a reciprocal process: just
as theology shaped medieval understandings of touch, acts of touching, in turn, were avenues
for approaching theological questions.

The dissertation takes as its primary focus the touch and embodied experience of
medieval women because gender difference in the Middle Ages was often described in
theological and sensory terms. Using tactile theology as a lens for teasing out the significance
of tactile language and metaphor, the following chapters explore how medieval readers and
writers considered (sometimes in conflicting terms) women's embodiment and women's
participation in religious life. Individual chapters offer case studies in the Junius 11
manuscript of Old English biblical poetry (particularly Genesis B, ca. 960–990), the
thirteenth-century Ancrene Wisse (ca. 1225) alongside one of its fifteenth-century Latin
translations, and the Book of Margery Kempe (ca. 1438). A final chapter on the
medievalism of Emily Dickinson further underscores how tactile theology supports

Beginning in the pious meditations of the eighteenth-century "Graveyard School," these writers spectralize the operations of the poem and fashion poetic structures into chambers of vigil where the ghost might be awaited and encountered. Alive to the recursive directions of contemporary historical poetics, this study challenges the emerging scholarly consensus on the ghost in the long nineteenth century as either a creature of fiction, born almost coeval with the novel in the work of Defoe, or a residual form, a remainder from folklore and oral balladry that glides uncertainly into Gothic's set dressing. Rather, just as poets envisioned their craft as instinct with ghostly measures, rhythms, and pauses, occult writers from antiquaries to Spiritualists substantialized and realized the ghost through the opaque lyricism and manifest technique of poetry. Accepting neoformalism's sound insistence on the historicity of form itself, my work nonetheless eschews New Formalism's frequent dismissal of the specter from the spectral: even the most evanescent, technical traces of the ghost in the poetry of the long nineteenth century recall and reflect living structures of preternatural belief and occult vision. Like Shelley in his "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty," these poets "sought for ghosts," and, if they were "not heard" and "saw them not," they could yet take solace in "the phantoms of a thousand hours," of the myriad ideal visions of poetry's ghosts across a long Graveyard Century. Across the Graveyard Century spanning from Thomas Gray to Thomas Hardy, this study argues that the ghost haunts poetry's sense of its own form precisely (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

How might directing our attention to the paper shortages in the British Commonwealth in the 1940s enliven perceptions of the debates over modernist aesthetics and nationhood in little magazines like Horizon and BIM, which circulated across the Atlantic? How do we answer for the ubiquity of rubber in the fiction of classic modernists like Joseph Conrad and James Joyce as well as its influence on the career of British Consulate turned Irish revolutionary, Roger Casement? What does the linking of character development to the development of land in Doris Lessing's The Grass is Singing and Sam Selvon's A Brighter Sun tell us about futures cultivated through land dispossession? These questions indicate important links between the transnational networks that constructed twentieth century geopolitics and transnational modernism. Modernist literary projects circulated within systems that often seemed surprisingly boundless, yet systems of imperialism and histories of over extraction were the inciting conditions for their existence. Therefore, when read together, transnational modernism and the influence of natural resources enliven our understanding of past patterns of thinking and shed light on our current moment of extreme extraction and climate crisis.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

I combine US Latinx cultural and media studies with lived experience to conduct close readings of how developers include Latinxs. Instead of characters who generate identificatory connections with the player via complex narrative, Latinxs manifest through an amalgam of stereotypes I call Player Juan. Latinxs appear as mostly non-player characters (NPCs) whose identities are based in discourse accepted as “truths” by AAA game developers who are mostly white men (≈ 85%). Player Juan takes inspiration from Shira Chess' Ready, Player Two which argues how male developers include women not based on lived experiences, but on perceptions about their play which creates the designed identity Player Two. 
Thus, my term equates to a framework challenging how AAA games include Latinxs through stereotypes and discourse.
	I begin recounting personal connections to video games, Loteria (Mexican Bingo), and storytelling to examine cultural lessons in games. The introduction engages Christopher Gonzalez's Permissible Narratives and how audience expectations dictate what is and is not permissible for Latinxs telling their stories through literature. The idea of permissibility weaves throughout this study as game developers continue to limit the permissibility of non-White identities, especially Latinx identities. 
	I posit video games are borders through an examination of stereotypes in popular game titles, such as Tomb Raider: Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, Red Dead Redemption 2, and The Last of Us 2. As an example, I theorize “crossing” to argue how players cross into games and how players can cross with or through characters they play or interact with.

To this research focus, I apply first the lens of material rhetorical theory, a field of study that seeks to understand connections between and amongst environments, humans, non-human animals, discourses, and objects. Doing so enables an articulation of the various elements with which graduate students come into contact during their study, as well as the influence those elements exert upon students' success and wellbeing. Of primary interest are neoliberal, capitalist ideologies undergirding the functioning of the university institution and promoting unhealthy productivity standards. Then, I discuss the concept of capacity, explored through readings in disability studies, human rights discourses, and legal studies. I do so to offer and examination of what is at stake when graduate students work too much for too little pay, and often subsequently experience a decreased ability to focus on what excites them about their research or take the time to care for themselves.

The next half of this project addresses the qualitative research undertaken, in which I distributed a survey to humanities graduate students across the country and then conducted semi-focused interviews with three survey respondents. In addition to methods used, I present findings from the gathered data, diving deep into a discussion of barriers to access and mental thriving students identified themselves as facing as a result of their enrollment during COVID-19. I then emphasize the human relationships, rooted in care and mutual support, that sustained these students. Finally, I present the affordances gained through sustained communion with others, particularly as they apply to students' intellectual, emotional, and physical capacity to accomplish their goals while enrolled in their given programs. This communion is the ultimate intervention made through this work—an asserta (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

This dissertation pushes back on the notion that video games require entirely new theories of narrative by applying rhetorical narrative theory to choice-based role-playing games, bringing a narrative school which has been primarily developed through literary texts to bear on a particular genre of narrative video game and asking what we can learn about both in the process. Across a series of three case studies (The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, the Mass Effect trilogy, and Fire Emblem: Three Houses), I seek to demonstrate how rhetorical narrative theory's conception of narrative—as purposeful communication within a feedback loop among authors, texts, and audiences—can provide useful ways forward for dealing with persistent tensions in video game narrative scholarship between narrative and gameplay, authorship and participation, and narrative potential and instantiation. At the same time, I use these case studies to reveal where rhetorical narrative theory can adapt in order to more meaningfully account for choice-based video game narratives within its default narrative paradigm. Ultimately, I argue that bringing rhetorical narrative and choice-based video games into conversation with one another illuminates intriguing new directions of inquiry for both rhetorical narrative theory and video game narrative scholarship more broadly.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

To that end, this project approaches popularizing discourse through style, discussing the ways in which stylistic features of texts communicate tacit relationships between YouTube popularizers and their audiences as well as the ways in which popularizers establish and maintain relationships with large public audiences. The project begins with a close analysis of one popularizer's work in order to distinguish popularization from teaching (another form of public-facing, specialist discourse), proceeds through an analysis of the work of several popularizers from various disciplines in order to account for the range of relationships that popularizers establish with audiences and to identify features characteristic of successful popularization, and then advances seven guidelines for effective popularization. The project concludes with an auto-ethnographic reflection on the author's own popularizing efforts, offering both a first-person perspective of the practical and theoretical considerations inherent in popularizing specialized knowledge and a proof-of-concept demonstration of the previously established guidelines' value for new and aspiring popularizers.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">In this dissertation, I analyze the engagement and framing of Indigenous, traditional
knowledges in climate science initiatives. In particular, I focus on Western expectations around
knowledge definitions and the sharing of knowledge as well as how traditional knowledges are, or
are not, framed as expert. When Western institutions frame traditional knowledges as non-expert or
less rigorous forms of knowledge production, Western institutions foster a stance toward traditional
knowledges that is incommensurable with the material realities of Indigenous communities. Western
institutions like universities value established forms of knowledge production like the scientific
method to the degree that such forms of knowledge production are often deemed both necessary and
universal for knowledge to be recognized as relevant and applicable. While nonindigenous
researchers in areas like biodiversity and renewable energy show an increasing interest in traditional
knowledges, many Indigenous communities have begun to protect and regulate their systems of
knowledge through mechanisms like research ordinances and agreements. Indigenous communities'
moves to protect their knowledges often stem from historical and contemporary instances of Western
knowledge theft and appropriation which in turn stems from the devaluation of traditional
knowledge. That is, traditional knowledges are often valued only as commodities, not as rigorous
systems of knowledge. I argue that engagement with traditional knowledges is essential in the
ongoing efforts to address complex systems problems like climate change and biodiversity loss, but
such engagements require Western institutions to acknowledge their ongoing colonial practices and
let go of their often rigid constraints on knowledge sharing and production: a move I frame as
rhetorical emptiness.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">For much of the past seventy years, discussion of authorial intention has often been seen as taboo in historical literary analysis. Monumental scholars such Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault wrote crucial essays that helped steer critical focus away from questions of intention, encouraging interpretation of the text itself as the ideal. While these contributions to the field were both valuable and necessary, paving the way for the reader-response approach that is now predominant in literary analysis, they had the unfortunate consequence of taking the role of intention out of the realm of interpretation entirely. The difficulty this consequence has presented is that to many literary analysts, “intention” is still viewed as a bad word, or at least one tainted by the idea that considering intentions precludes other readerly or critical interpretations. The field of book history has largely steered clear of the negative imputations of intention, as understanding what an author (or other agents involved in publication) intended by choices made in a primary text is essential for how that publication can be parsed from a material standpoint. The divide between book history and literary analysis has gradually been narrowing, but the reluctance to fully embrace intention as one of many tools to explore the interpretational possibilities of historical literary texts is a problem that I seek to address.

	This dissertation focuses on four editions of poetry from the mid-seventeenth century to demonstrate how the intentions of authors and other agents in the production of literary works have a direct impact on how those works can be interpreted. My methodology is rooted in book history, but my key objective throughout is to apply that approach to literary analysis by using what we can both definitively know and reasonably establish about intentions to guide close-readings of the works themselves. Doing so reveals that, far from precluding interpretation, considering the orig (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

a method of providing data interoperability of editorial encodings, the actual realization 
of this ideal has proven elusive, at best. Overlapping hierarchies of editorial perspective plague the practice, making digital editions not only unusable in any context beyond their own, limited display of the text, but also limit the number of different editorial perspectives that can be represented within the original encoding. Historically, this failing has been laid at the feet of the de facto standard of the practice, the TEI Guidelines and its XML schema. However, I contend that it is not so much the technology or the standard that is to blame as it is the model of text which informs both, a model which sees text as a solitary ideal predating any document witnesses. Instead, I propose a different model of text to inform our encoding choices, a model which sees text as the product of our interactions with documents, the result of documents and not their cause.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

Gatlinburg, which experienced a devastating wildfire in 2016, is a mountain town and tourist destination that borders the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Planning and policy decisions often result from top-down processes that do not adequately represent the experiences and interests of residents, leaving residents without actual agency in the rebuilding of their community. By incorporating the stories and perspectives of various stakeholders—residents, tourists, and business owners—this project provides insight into disaster response at the level of community and addresses concerns about environmental, economic, and cultural sustainability. This dissertation reveals how the study of vernacular architecture in the context of disaster and environmental change can inform our understanding of the built landscape and processes of community rebuilding. 

At the nexus of folklore studies and vernacular architecture studies, this project employs folklore research methodologies (in-depth fieldwork, participant observation, and ethnographic interviews) to elucidate how people understand, respond to, and characterize their changing environment. Through the lens of vernacular architecture—or, the study of common, everyday buildings—this dissertation examines the built and natural environment of Gatlinburg with attention to the form, use, style, and (re)construction of its residential and commercial structures. I consider the physical, spatial layout of the town, as well as its web of social relationships as they contributed to effective disaster response, evacuation, and rebuilding efforts.

When I began my research, the problems I sought to explore included: (1) erasure of femme, queer, Latinx representation in mainstream media—especially as it pertains to speculative fiction (2) a need for Latinx media scholarship that is focused on not only cisgender Latinas/os, but studies dedicated to the representation of femme and queer representations in recent twenty-first media (3) a need for Latinx media scholarship specifically focused on how femme and queer Latinxs are represented in the speculative storytelling modes of literature, film, television, music, and comics. My project of Fantastic Femmes aims to fill this need through an exploration of speculative genres like fantasy, magical realism, and horror. In locating Latinx cultural productions that are both (1) speculative and (2) focused on femme and queer Latinx representation, it is my hope that my work will encourage future and current scholars to continue contributing to the lineages I have outlined in my chapters. I believe in the power of stories, and see my dissertation as a creative and academic exercise in exploring the fantastic possibilities of femme, queer, Latinx storytelling.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

I examine one effect of climate change—extreme flooding—to explore how Appalachian storytellers address socioenvironmental life throughout time and space. Through their flood stories, people creatively reckon with historic environmental destruction, ongoing social marginalization, and increasing climate crisis. This project emphasizes how local disasters can simultaneously be informed by and inform larger global conversations on life and living in and beyond Capitalocene times. Focusing on a specific type of environmental disaster—flooding—within a specific marginalized place—Appalachia—throughout time is one way to better notice how creative activism, life, and livability already exist despite science skepticism, environmental destruction, and capitalist ruins. The connections among various flood stories throughout time and space allow us to link past, current, and future life in and beyond the Capitalocene by moving in and out of local storytelling to understand what it means to be human in an increasingly precarious world of economic uncertainty and political polarization, heightened social and biological disarray, and intense ecological disaster. By centering the environmental storytelling of those who historically experience the combined effects of oppression and destruction, this project amplifies the diverse and creative activism of people who provide models for livability through ecological crisis.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

Starting from the vantage point of the global South, this dissertation examines five major filmmakers associated with slowness: Lucrecia Martel (Argentina), Alfonso Cuaron (Hollywood/Mexico), Natalia Almada (US/Mexico), Kelly Reichardt (US), and Apichatpong Weerasethakul (Thailand). Slowness in cinema has popularly and academically been theorized from an aesthetic or national perspective since Matthew Flanagan first coined the term “slow cinema.” However, to theorize slowness as a global aesthetic flattens the political textures of cinemas that arise from marginalized markets with their own film histories. The recent steady growth in international co-production, as well as historical movement of film within and between markets, also indicate that national definitions are increasingly inapplicable to transnational cinemas. Latin American cinema is an example of historical and current transnational production as films circulate between nations in the home market and internationally on the film festival circuit, as well as cultivating a unique character outside Hollywood's cultural dominance. Looking at slow cinema from its geopolitical context reveals the critique of current and past global systems that contribute to iniquity including the erasure of Black and Indigenous peoples from Latinx histories and identities, entrenched racial hierarchies of coloniality, and how these structures inflect and reflect attitudes toward the natural world. Expanding the hemispheric Americas to the Asia Pacific, another site of conquest and US imperial ideation, experimental film translates the personal to the political in an intimate portraiture of human and natural ecologies.

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;"> This dissertation examines excremental language and plot devices within late-Elizabethan and Jacobean English drama, particularly in the plays of Thomas Middleton, William Rowley, Francis Beaumont, John Fletcher, and William Shakespeare. The project explores the overlapping tensions between the dual definitions of excrement as “outgrowth” and “waste product” to examine how late-sixteenth- and early-seventeenth-century English drama connects the language of excrement with the language of erotic desire. English Renaissance playwrights regularly reference excrement to consider the relative worth of individuals within their social contexts, but they also use it to think through the relative worth of sexual practices and forms of sexual desire. 
This project extends the work of scholars such as Gail Kern Paster and Will Stockton by emphasizing the materiality of excremental products as well as their potential to challenge, and not just reinforce, sixteenth- and seventeenth-century gender hierarchies within drama. These excremental products function differently across different genres. Chapters 2 and 3 examine representations of sex and excrement in early-seventeenth-century city comedy and marriage comedy, focusing on fluid excrements in relation to subversive sex and reproduction. These chapters argue that early modern English comedy often restores hierarchical order by using excrement to discipline deviant sexual desire, but it also exposes the instability of those hierarchies. City comedies such as Thomas Middleton's A Chaste Maid in Cheapside figure the products of sexual reproduction, children, as excrements, at various points valuable outgrowths or valueless waste products. Misogynist-taming comedies such as John Fletcher's The Tamer Tamed allow women characters to weaponize their excrement against men threatening early modern ideals of companionate marriage. 
Chapters 4 and 5 examine tragedies that reaffirm sexual and familial hierarchies, but also upend them.  (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

Institutions have increasingly turned to video game technologies for addressing mental disability and/or mental health in pedagogical contexts. Yet there has been little critical consideration of the assumptions about mental disability informing these gaming technologies. I suggest that discourses of mental disability, mental health, game design, and institutional implementation construct an affective rhetoric of pain. For example, designers might harm the player for rhetorical effect, and/or highlight how play can minimize pain and foster happiness. These games therefore raise considerations of resilience, or the psychological ability to “bounce back” from traumatic or painful experiences (APA, 2012). Through a multidisciplinary framework of feminist, queer, and crip approaches to video game rhetoric and institutional critique, I trace how neoliberal resilience rhetoric has been used to justify video games for pedagogical and institutional use by managing or mitigating mental disability. I specifically identify a spatial principle I call the resiliency paradox: a normative and dominant rhetorical logic that normalizes pain and/or violence under the pretense that a space is safe. The resiliency paradox sustains ableist institutional structures and game design principles by denying institutional reform. By examining, critiquing, and ultimately rejecting the resiliency paradox, I identify opportunities for resistance through play while affirming differential movements through institutional space. </div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">This dissertation examines various ways in which televisual aesthetics have found their way into postmodern narrative texts. As home viewing via television challenged the dominance of film, I explore how postmodern authors publishing codex books between 1969 and 2006 have incorporated aesthetics readers should interpret as televisual aesthetics. The first chapter introduces key terms and methodologies while situating this project within the lineage of studies examining the relationship between the literary period of modernism and subsequently postmodernism and media studies. The second chapter interprets the cinematic-turned-televisual technological capability of reversal (e.g. rewinding) as a means of exploring a specific visual trait in three novels across the trajectory of postmodern literature to situate the postmodern novel within a larger media landscape. The third and fourth chapters each examine a specific period of television technology and history, and corresponding literature that explores the media ecology of that period. Chapter three addresses how authors reflected on the growing televisual omnipresence they experienced in the 1960s through the 1970s in their work. The final chapter of this project addresses how post-2000 authors were influenced by the increasingly audiovisual nature of the Internet, and how the vastness of the Internet impacted our sense of being in the world. Analyzing the manner in which postmodern authors have incorporated what I identify as televisual aesthetics in their texts, I assert that the role of television within the media ecology of the 20th and 21st centuries cannot be ignored or viewed as secondary to film. Additionally, this project suggests that authors turning to televisual aesthetics in their works consider notions of temporality afforded to different media, and therefore incorporate them to employ a unique temporal aspect to their narratives. </div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">Marginal Affinities seeks to explain how character as a formal resource is shaped by global
geopolitics in diverse 20th and 21st century Anglophone novels. My explanation synthesizes
Edward Said's stance of secular criticism, which treats all literary forms foremost as historical
and political phenomena, with rhetorical narrative theory, a major method of formalist literary
analysis. Whereas current approaches contextualize Anglophone novels through regional,
national, cosmopolitan, or planetary histories and treat formalism with suspicion, what I call a
secular rhetorical criticism offers a method of reading transnationally through literary form.
When interpreted through this method, the forms of contemporary Anglophone novels reveal
history more clearly instead of making history opaque. In its focus on the politics of character,
Marginal Affinities finds a new locus of affinities between novels by writers of marginal
experiences. In each chapter, I compare how these novels invoke and then transform conventions
governing character development in a world marked by hierarchies of geopolitical influence:
“developed” and “developing,” “first” and “third.” For instance, postcolonial bildungsromane
such as Chimamanda Adichie's Purple Hibiscus and Pankaj Mishra's The Romantics treat
character bildung as emblematic of not just individual and national development after
decolonization, but also cultural and political sovereignty unattainable under the conditions of
global capitalism and neo-imperialism. In order to challenge the dominance of Western
epistemologies to the development of the novel as a genre, Helon Habila's Oil on Water and Earl
Lovelace's The Wine of Astonishment turn to oblique modes of characterization in which nonmodern
communal interiority is represented through symbols, environments, and religious
practices significant to those communities. Jennifer Egan's A Visit from the Goon Squad and

I argue that Disability Memoir destabilizes the concept of normativity and, as a literary genre, often disrupts popular constructions of narrative linearity. Although Disability Memoir is not a new category, my research moves away from distinct classification tools (“autism memoir,” “cancer memoir,” etc.) and the focus on white physically disabled activists, towards life writing that captures intersectional and multifaceted disability experiences. I approach this interdisciplinary project from the standpoint of a memoirist, rhetorician, educator, and Disability Studies scholar, interrogating not only what I teach and why I teach it, but also how I teach it. Utilizing pedagogy as methodology, I explore the dual entry points of content and process, indicating how specific texts demonstrate effective writing practices while reinforcing creative construction as political action. At the center of this work is what it means to describe experiences often understood as “unspeakable,” or resistant to language. Through this interrogation, I identify disability memoirs as texts that combat practices of erasure and instead leave evidence.

Scholarship on these issues in English literature usually begins with the late-nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century, when discourse on contraception and birth control emerged as a parallel current with the women's suffrage movement in the United States and Great Britain. However, the way discourse on abortion in particular manifested during the earlier part of the Victorian Era has not been explored in depth, leaving a discursive gap regarding understandings of women's reproductive health in nineteenth-century print culture. Reading Con(tra)ceptions: Women, Abortion, and Reproductive Health in Victorian Literature and Culture, 1840-1880, aims to remedy this gap by exploring abortion more directly, specifically, and contextually in mid-Victorian literature – especially as represented in the novel, contemporary periodicals, and various forms of epistolary works. Focusing on realist texts, I consider Elizabeth Gaskell's Mary Barton with an eye toward the historically classed associations behind herb gardens and how access to different forms of medicine informs depictions of working-class motherhood. I then examine the ways George Eliot's Middlemarch effectively works to counter rather than reinforce Darwinian notions of “male-dominated choice,” instead underscoring how representations of family planning showcase instances of women's reproductive choice. Finally, I explore how examples of Victorian erotica such as My Secret Life also maintain critical rhetorical roots in realism, providing important, explicit glimpses into mid- century discourses about sexuality – including notably clearer, straightforward discussions about abortion and women's reproduc (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

As a folklorist, I am interested in examining these tattoos through a performance approach, and as a material culture scholar specifically, I am interested in scholarship about everyday aesthetics and their implication not only as they help us understand the tattoos, but also, as folklorist Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett directs us, to consider how everyday aesthetics (which I propose as the way we most fruitfully can understand tattoos) give form to value. To that end, my dissertation provides an overview of the conversation of material culture as folklore scholars have approached it, setting my work with tattoos in the larger context of material culture and more directly among works by scholars' studies of adornment, bodily adornment, and adornments as a type of collection. In addition, because MS illness-awareness tattoos are a form of illness-narrative, my project considers some of the conversation of narratives from disability studies. My discussion ends with a chapter in which I bring together folklorists' ideas about aesthetics in an attempt to create a conversation among those scholars that helps us better understand the powerful role aesthetics plays in everyday life and, in particular, a discussion of the problem of binaries in discourse on art and aesthetics. </div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">This dissertation challenges the standard narrative of nineteenth-century literary secularization by attending to British texts that engage liturgy and ritual. According to once standard accounts of secularization, the development of modernity—the rise of the natural sciences, the spread of market economies, and so forth—necessarily entails the decline and eventual demise of religion. Until recently, many readings of Romantic and Victorian literature have assumed this trajectory of progressive secularization. However, for the last twenty years, scholarship from a variety of disciplines—history, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, and theology—has complicated and often rejected the notion that modernization brings about the death of faith. Such scholarship frequently observes how the concept of religion itself—especially when construed as private belief in supernatural ideas—is a construction of early modern Europe and is born simultaneously with the notion of the secular as the sphere of public reason. 

Drawing on these recent revisions of secularization theory, I ask why—in a so-called age of doubt—many nineteenth-century writers of various confessional stances nevertheless become fascinated by liturgy and ritual. Rather than simply accept the picture of religion as primarily an interior, otherworldly phenomenon, these writers, I argue, turn to liturgy to enflesh faith—that is, to resist modernity's characteristic bifurcations of natural/supernatural, body/soul, reason/faith, and so on. At once spiritual and material, liturgy incarnates unseen realities in concrete forms—bread, wine, water, the architectural arrangement of churches and temples, and the temporal patterns of ritual calendars. Romantic and Victorian writers deploy this incarnational power for a host of reasons: to reinvest the natural world and material objects with spiritual meaning, to reimagine the human person as porous and malleable rather than as closed and mechanical, to question the homoge (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

By the Book canvasses a broad range American novels that depicted many of the organizational developments and institutional operations of municipal law enforcement in United States cities from the late-nineteenth through the early-twentieth century. I examine the rise of the police procedural as a literary genre in the true-crime fiction of Julian Hawthorne and the detective novels of Anna Katharine Green that promote the investigative processes of the New York Police Department and its specialized crime units. I examine the futurist fiction of J. W. Roberts and Frederick Upham Adams, which pushed back against debates about law enforcement's own future in their explorations of interpersonal crime, criminal enterprise, and riot control in metropolises such as Boston, Chicago, and New York. Finally, I examine social problem novels by Sutton E. Griggs that tackle the Jim Crow police state created in Southern cities like Richmond and Nashville through police abuse and neglect toward black Americans. Ultimately, the story that emerges in By the Book is about competing civic narratives -- of the police as collective protagonist and collective antagonist in American society.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">In recent years, two trends have emerged in the landscape of women-centric television series: (1) protagonists who are deemed unlikable, unattractive, and/or uncouth and (2) series in which the creator and protagonist share a body—as well as, often, a name and/or other biographical details or experiences. In Unbecoming Girls: Televising Millennial Femininity, I examine six comedy series that do both: Girls (2012-2017), Broad City (2014-2019), Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (2015-2019), Insecure (2016—), Fleabag (2016-2019), and SMILF (2017-2019). As television has, generally, moved towards more complex narratives, morally ambiguous protagonists, and a blend of episodic and serial elements, the above series build upon this foundation to produce characters and narratives that are unbecoming in their depictions of unladylike, inappropriate protagonists—the “unbecoming girls” to whom the title alludes—who dwell in the life stage between adolescence and adulthood; their rejection of conventional, teleological narrative structure; and their presentation of semi-autobiographical stories authored and portrayed by the same woman. 

Beyond the influence of televisual developments, the influx of “unbecoming” series is symptomatic of larger cultural trend including a renewed emphasis and politicization of feminism in media reflective of a shift away from postfeminist thought; the influence of social media on women's models of self-production and presentation; and feelings of aimlessness and precarity ascribed to the millennial generation as a whole and attributed to the economically uncertain era in which they came of age. These factors have inspired, as Meg Tully argues, a branch of feminism that values sincerity, gender play, sex positivity, “acceptance of contradiction,” and “messiness of identity.” The unbecoming girl, I argue, is a reflection of this mindset.

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">My dissertation, Performing Brawn and Sass: Strength and Disability in Black Women's Writing, examines contemporary African American narratives to gauge how writers re-imagine, complicate, or even reject the trope of the Strong Black Woman. I define the “Strong Black Woman” as a standard that black women are assumed to inherently demonstrate. As opposed to the demureness of conventional femininity, the Strong Black Woman is portrayed as bold and outspoken. In addition to being physically strong and able to labor, she possesses the emotional and mental resolve that allows her to hold her family and her community together during hardship. The cultural endurance of the figure is a major problem I cite in my dissertation. Because the Strong Black Woman is such a cultural mainstay in African American literature and mainstream media, she has become a source of racial pride exclusively synonymous with black womanhood. However, I identify the Strong Black Woman as an ableist ideal that oversimplifies black female narrative voice and erases bodily variety.
I argue that by rejecting the Strong Black Woman's ableism and investment in self-sacrifice while adapting her dedication to survival and independence, black women writers present black female characters less familiar than the Strong Black Woman, but more complex and human. I take a two-pronged approach to my methodology, placing scholarship from black feminist theory and disability studies in conversation with one another. Black feminist theory's investigation of race and gender, and the dynamics between black women and systems of power greatly informs my character analysis. Furthermore, disability studies critics have shown how normativity isn't an objective, universal measure, but is instead an extension of hegemony, marking and policing all bodies that exist outside of the white ideal. My dissertation uses this conceptual framework to explore how the representation of black women's bodyminds and behavior as inherently (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">This dissertation offers a folkloristic analysis of personal experience narratives of wildfire as instruments of critical engagement with disaster events in a California community. Based on fieldwork and ethnographic interviews conducted in the Mountain Drive community of Santa Barbara County, this dissertation examines the personal narratives of seven storytellers, each of whom offers a unique perspective on how wildfires have shaped their understandings of selfhood, property, and public safety in their local environment. I argue that storytelling offers a space for individuals to process the disruptive forces of natural disasters both in their own lives and within the context of their community. More than merely reflecting on past experience, however, wildfire stories allow individuals to assert patterns and build cohesion across their multiple experiences of wildfire. Thus, the stories individuals tell about wildfire are future-facing, offering ways of understanding not only past wildfires but also the potential for future fires. 

My fieldsite, Mountain Drive, is located in the rugged, fire-prone foothills of Santa Barbara County. The community was founded shortly after the Second World War by Bobby and Floppy (Florence) Hyde. Influenced by the bohemian countercultural movements of the beat generation and the back-to-the-earth movement, Bobby and Floppy wanted to live simply and remotely in a community of like-minded friends and family. As the community developed, they became known for their creative and irreverent community festivals. While local and vernacular histories about Mountain Drive typically emphasize a static notion of the neighborhood's “golden age” in the 1950s and 1960s, I emphasize the social and economic changes that give shape to the current manifestation of the community. Moreover, I explore how forces of continuity and change on Mountain Drive are entangled with the community's history of wildfire and disaster.

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">This dissertation, Today Your Barista Is: Genre Characteristics in The Coffee Shop Alternate Universe, works to categorize and introduce a heretofore unrecognized genre within the medium of fanfiction: The Coffee Shop Alternate Universe (AU). Building on previous sociological and ethnographic work within Fan Studies, scholarship that identifies fans as transformative creators who use fanfiction as a means of promoting progressive viewpoints, this dissertation argues that the Coffee Shop AU continues these efforts within a defined set of characteristics, merging the goals of fanfiction as a medium with the specific goals of a genre. These characteristics include the Coffee Shop AU's structure, setting, archetypes, allegories, and the remediation of related mainstream genres, particularly the romantic comedy. The purpose of defining the Coffee Shop AU as its own genre is to help situate fanfiction within mainstream literature conventions—in as much as that's possible—and laying the foundation for future close reading. This work also helps to demonstrate which characteristics are a part of a communally developed genre as opposed to individual works, which may assist in legal proceedings moving forward. However, more crucially this dissertation serves to encourage the continued, formal study of fanfiction as a literary and cultural phenomenon, one that is beginning to closely analyze the stories fans produce alongside the fans themselves. Far from writing chaotically, fanfiction authors have spent the last six decades developing structured forms of literature for online spaces, of which the Coffee Shop AU is a part, yet most scholarship has yet to acknowledge that structure outside of overly broad categories (such as slash) or equally specific tropes (such as bed sharing). Defining what is currently one of the most popular genres written today—a genre that is the product of and is now helping to produce other genres—is the first step in filling this gap. </div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">Composition scholars and writing instructors have mobilized developments in theories about audience, rhetorical labor, and the rhetorical situation to help students examine and interact with exigences outside the classroom. Pedagogies such as service-learning, client-based teaching, and community-engaged writing situate students with(in) communities, clients, and/or partners for the purpose of immersing them in "real-world" rhetorical contexts. Although collaborating across rhetorical situations that expand beyond the classroom can create educational opportunities and meaningful projects, such an undertaking comes at a cost. 

Successfully understanding, managing, and delegating labor within client- and partner-based composition pedagogy can be a challenge to coordinate effectively. Misunderstanding complexity in client- and partner-based composition courses can result in unsatisfactory or unfulfilling outputs, unethical authority imbalances, and marginalized course participants and partners. Addressing these challenges depends on localized and inductively derived frameworks to navigate this labor distribution well. From my case study of a partner-based digital composition course, I posit two frameworks for comprehending and executing ethical and successful client- and partner-based composition courses: a "macro-rhetoric" model to understand and strategize rhetorical labor, and an authority|collaboration matrix to negotiate distributing that rhetorical labor.

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">The Postbellum, Pre-Harlem era is often overlooked in African American scholarship. My 
dissertation proposes a renewed investigation of this era by studying Postbellum, Pre-Harlem 
African American writers and their negotiation with a prominent discourse during this period: 
African American folklore. Since “the folk” were repeatedly equated to Black Americans and 
folklore was used as a measure of African Americans' post-emancipation “progress,” nineteenth
century Black intellectuals, recognized nineteenth- and twentieth-century folklore as a key site in 
shaping Black representation. Moreover, they were “active participants” in fashioning the 
foundations of American folklore (Waters and Hampton 22-46; Lamothe 23-32; Moody-Turner 
4, 89). 

Thus my dissertation explores the “sites of concern and negotiation” that Postbellum, Pre
Harlem writers encountered while creating narratives that incorporated African American 
folklore (Moody-Turner 13); I seek to characterize and historicize the Postbellum, Pre-Harlem's 
“racialized regime of folk representation,” discourses that intersected to create the representation 
of the folk. I conduct this analysis by using a three-pronged approach that combines insights 
from folklore theory, narrative theory, and African American literature. I call this methodology 
“positioning.” Using this approach, I study how (1) African Americans were positioned as the 
folk in a racialized regime, (2) how African Americans (re)positioned themselves, and (3) how 
African Americans positioned other Black people as the folk. With this methodology, alongside a history of the social construction of “Black folk” in early African American folklore studies 
and nineteenth-century popular discourse, I examine Charles Chesnutt's The Marrow of 
Tradition, Anna Julia Cooper's A Voice from the South, Pauline Hopkins's Contending Forces, 
Alice Dunbar-Nelson's “The Goodness of St. Rocque,” Frances E.W. Harper's Iola Leroy, and

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">This dissertation considers references to soil in the work of Renaissance English poet Edmund Spenser, arguing that Spenser uses soil in his work to reflect upon issues of interpretation, representation, and allegory. Examining The Shepheardes Calender, A View of the State of Ireland, and Book I of The Faerie Queene, I argue that soil in Spenser's work is neither simply a metaphor nor simply a reference to the real world environment of Renaissance England. Rather, it embodies a complex and shifting signification that reflects the broad range of influences on Spenser's life: humanist training, the English efforts to colonize Ireland, and the overlapping discourses of Protestantism and English nationalism. Because these varying and at times contradictory discourses all used references to and metaphors of soil, soil, I argue, became for Spenser a useful way of exploring how meaning is assigned, navigated, and understood, especially in instances where there are conflicting influences upon the creation of meaning. I argue that soil's ability to call attention to the processes of meaning-making and interpretation have important implications for a range of Spenserian topics, not least of them being the nature of allegory. But I also argue that Spenser's use of soil has implications more broadly for how the nonhuman world of the Renaissance is understood. Ultimately, I argue that Spenser—and, by extension, the Renaissance more broadly—requires a different way of thinking about the environment than is commonplace in ecocriticism and contemporary culture today, a way that is alert to the Renaissance's mutually constitution of the “literary” and the “real.”</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">The Girls' Room: Bedroom Culture and the Ephemeral Archive in the 1990s documents how feminist discourse found itself in an uneasy intimacy with mass culture at the end of the millennium by tracking how girls and young women renegotiated their relationship to mass media from the privacy of their bedrooms. In the mid-1990s, a self-help genre emerged that addressed anxieties about how best to empower the generation of girls growing up in the shadow of the Women's Liberation Movement. These works warned that girls' unregulated access to and consumption of mass media – particularly from their bedrooms – made them more oppressed than any previous generation. At the same time, young women were capitalizing on the privacy of their bedrooms to create zines and comics that radically reconceptualized feminism's presence in public culture. The Girls' Room is the first full-length study to engage the girls' bedroom as a generative space in pop culture and literature that animates competing stories about girls as consumers, media makers, and collectors. Though the bedroom's close ties to domesticity and consumer culture have vexed feminist scholars, I trace how the third wave's call for media literacy was transformed with girls into “media intimacy” in this space. Even now, this relationship continues to shape how we conceive of girlhood as girls bring the world into their bedrooms through their phones.  </div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">This dissertation examines how recent works of Black apocalyptic fiction represent the opportunities and limits of crisis as a driver of radical social change. Black apocalyptic fiction deals explicitly and substantively with what it means to be Black during, and in the aftermath of, apocalypse. It is a subset of the genre of Black speculative fiction, a broad category for texts by the African diaspora that resist purely realist or mimetic representation of the world and encompasses several genres, most commonly science fiction, fantasy, magical realism, and horror. Black speculative fiction has garnered considerable academic interest in recent years and has been recognized as a rich site for analyzing race and racial differences in popular culture. This project joins the emerging critical conversation of scholars such as Isiah Lavender III, Ramon Saldivar, Lisa Yaszek, and Marleen Barr, to analyze how Black writers engage with, challenge, and revise the conventions of the speculative genres. However, critical engagement with apocalypse in Black speculative fiction is still relatively sparse, as is scholarship addressing the representations of race and gender in Black apocalyptic fiction.

Using intersectionality as a theoretical framework, I address this gap in current scholarship through a sustained consideration of Black apocalyptic fiction and the intersections of race and gender therein.  This dissertation begins to answer the question of how race and gender impact the potential for radical change in the wake of extreme crisis. Literary representations of apocalypse provide one form of what Nnedi Okorafor calls “the distancing and associating effect” of science fiction. They depict familiar spaces made strange through the lens of total destruction. Apocalypse narratives have a long history and have served many functions over time, including articulation of societal anxieties, social critique, and utopian striving.

In the first chapter, I read events from Malcolm X's childhood as expressed in The Autobiography of Malcolm X (1965) as metaphor used to reconstruct an environment in which Black death and anti-Black surveillance practices permeates the lives of Black Americans. In this chapter I contrast the rhetorical gestures X uses to those James Baldwin employs in The Fire Next Time in which he writes to his young nephew and recalls a visit with the Elijah Muhammad. Contrasting the two titles, I suggest that the rhetorical gestures of Malcolm X — centering Blackness and decentering whiteness in the interest of self-declaration constitute the prevailing rhetorical gestures of the Black Power Era while those rhetorical gestures used by Baldwin — centering whiteness and upholding rhetorics of colorblindness — constitute prevailing rhetorical gestures of the Civil Rights Movement. Overall, this chapter illustrates how the rhetorical gestures of Malcolm X capitalizes on the specters of Black death and anti-Black surveillance practices which become central themes in the Black Power Era. In the second chapter of this project I focus on Amiri Baraka's Dutchman (1964) to explain how Black death and anti-Black surveillance practices structure the play. In respect to the overarching claim of my project I use close reading to frame Baraka's essay “The Revolutionary Theatre” as a response to the forces of Black death and anti-Black surveillance practices and a guide for reading through the rhetorical gestures found in Dutchman. In the third chapter of this project I analyze one of Gil Scott-Heron's best known songs, “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised.” The analysis situates “Revolution” within the genus of Black Arts Movement works which employ Black nationalist rhetoric to protest the specters of Black death and anti-Black surveillance practices.

H. Powell, 2007). There is a particular need for research on how Black Americans engage with digital technologies beyond school settings. This project fills this research gap by examining the print and digital literacy practices of five Black family reunions. In this qualitative study, I sought to answer two questions. First, what are the roles of reading, writing, and digital technologies in how Black family reunions are planned, executed, and sustained? Second, what does the study of digital practices in Black family reunions contribute to how we define and conceptualize digital literacy? To answer these research questions, I introduced and used a Critical Race-Grounded Theory methodology (Malagon, Huber, &amp; Velez, 2009) tailored to Rhetoric, Composition, and Literacy studies. My data collection methods included interviews, participant observation, and print and digital content analysis. 
My study yielded two major findings. In my first finding, I show that the primary role of reading, writing, and digital technologies is to help families organize as a business. My analysis illustrated how document genres and material artifacts circulated internally and externally to help families position themselves as business organizations. I argued that the work of these five families should prompt scholars and practitioners to think more expansively about how we define professional communication. In my second finding I show the families' ability to strategically engage multiple digital platforms to complete the work of the reunion. My analysis illustrated how these families traveled across a variety of platforms to accommodate family members of all ages, promote family values, and to meet individual research and networking goals. I conclude that these families' multiplatform engagement pu (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

This line of inquiry, established in Chapter 1, orients toward digital and multimodal compositions, which offer rhetorical power within and beyond the classroom. Furthermore, digital media composing, when oriented through queer rhetorics, can be a space for disidentifcation from institutionalized accountability logics and related oppressive systems (Munoz, 1999; Ahmed, 2006). In turn, this project studies assessment practices (Chapter 2), curricular developments (Chapter 3), and pedagogical engagements (Chapter 4) as conduits for queer possibilities in digital media composing classrooms.

Chapter 2 troubles current neoliberal accountability logics while tracing counter-histories of assessment. Assessment, a notable concept in education and rhetoric, composition, and digital media studies, is easily positioned and co-opted by neoliberal accountability logics animated by learning outcome regimes. However, by engaging early discussions of assessment ethics, the social justice turn in assessment, and the affect of digital media/multimodal assessment, this project shows assessment can and should be (re)oriented as a tool of queer possibility through an ethic of response-ability. 

Following the theorization of the opening chapters, the third and fourth chapters are grounded by a practitioner inquiry project (cf. Cochran-Smith and Lytle, 1993; Nichols and Cormack, 2017), which collected and analyzed qualitative data in a digital media composing course. The data, when reviewed using qualitative data analysis methods, materialize and triangulate claims of queer possibilities in digital media composing by accounting fo (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">This dissertation examines three case studies of occupational folklore in early medieval England. Each of these cases reveal how medieval patterns of work could be disrupted in different ways. The first explores the language of solidarity in Rogation traditions by showing that ecclesiastics presented a Church-centered view of community through the festival. Because “community” is an abstract, vague concept, this case study argues that scholars can more clearly define the types of relationships that hold a community together.  The second examines an emerging genre of estate management tracts between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. Although scientific management is thought to begin under later capitalist industrial systems, this chapter argues that early medieval aristocrats were already experimenting with management science. Texts like Gerefa and Walter of Henley's agricultural treatises attempted to codify the knowledge and techniques needed to run an estate by removing it from the realm of orality and experiential learning. The third case investigates the hidden labor of medical practitioners. This chapter argues that medieval medicine depended on labor that is invisible in the textual record. Each case study draws on contemporary theories about labor to show how scholars can broaden the language through which we present the past to students in university classrooms.   </div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

Consciously or unconsciously, Victorian literary critics and twenty-first century readers have internalized Freud, and continue to read through the psychoanalytic assumption that all desire is erotic. But the sexual paradigm does not encompass all expressions of narrative desire. In “Beyond Sex: Arotic Desire in the Victorian Realist Novel,” I argue that refusing to see all relational desire as inevitably about sexual pairing unsettles traditional ways of reading characters and relationships in the Victorian novel. Reading for “arotic desire”—a term I coined to indicate impulses other than eros—I argue that Victorian realism both creates and depends on structural and formal narrative possibilities offered by non-normative relational desire. I consider Anthony Trollope's Can You Forgive Her?, Charles Dickens's Dombey and Son, and Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure as case studies for my theory. I offer close readings of arotically-motivated characters in these novels that challenge our preconceptions of how characters relate, and of what types of relationships the novel values. I then use these readings to suggest that arotic desire functions in a concrete, formal way in the novel—revealing narrative possibilities and strategies beyond what is offered by standard erotic forms such as the love triangle or the marriage plot. </div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">Literary representations of incest occur with marked frequency during the Romantic era—roughly equating to the years between 1780 and 1830.  Much of this period overlaps with that of the tumultuous socio-historical timeline of the French Revolution, in which extensive reforms to both family and state authority in France were seen and debated across the Channel in England.  So, too, was this a period in which the English revealed an intense focus on kinship and marriage alliance as a form of achieving social and economic security.  This dissertation investigates the way in which these socio-political concerns are interrogated through the incest motif—a motif itself innately invested in transgression as it portrays kinship bonds that refuse to be constrained by societal laws or expectations.  I provide close readings of the incest motif in more than one dozen texts including the male Romantic poets Lord Byron and Percy Shelley, gothic writer Matthew Lewis, dramatist James Cobb, and the novelists Frances Burney, Mary Shelley, Ann Radcliffe, and Mary Robinson.  In so doing, this dissertation reveals that this politicized motif took on a wide variety of forms that cannot be encapsulated by a single category or political ideology.  Rather, I demonstrate that representing politics through incest is a feature of Romantic-era authorship and one which reveals an underlying moral mode for conceiving of one's highly individualized political ideology.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

Yet few studies consider the writing-related pedagogical practices of disciplinary instructors. This study contributes to WID scholarship by exploring the writing-related expectations instructors in two disciplines (history and social work) hold for their undergraduates. Disciplinary instructors often aim to impart their discourse communities' values to their students. Thus, study of instructors' writing-related pedagogical practices and expectations for student writing can also reveal instructors' writing-related disciplinary values.

I explore participating instructors' pedagogical practices, writing assignments, and perspectives on teaching writing to identify not only the instructors' expectations for student writing, but the disciplinary ideologies and values underlying those expectations. In this qualitative study, methods of data collection include: semester-long observations in two undergraduate courses, one taught by a history instructor, one by a social work instructor; analysis of the instructors' written feedback on student texts; and interviews with the two instructors, as well as with eight additional history instructors and six additional social work instructors. I coded and analyzed these data using iterative methods of constant comparison based on grounded theory.

Findings revealed participating instructors' pedagogical strategies and expectations for disciplinary assignments. The two classroom instructors each engaged students in the thinking practices valued in their respective disciplines. The history instructor, for example, encouraged students to perceive historical texts as subjective documents to be analyzed, while the social work instructor introduced students to multiple example client case studies to prepare them for client assessments in future socia (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">Pathology and Pity traces the interdependence of medical and moral models of disability in American literature of the long nineteenth-century, from Royall Tyler's The Algerine Captive (1797), to several short stories by Edgar Allan Poe in the 1840s, to the promotional materials of stuttering school literature from the 1880s to the 1920s, to Herman Melville's Billy Budd, unpublished at the time of Melville's death but composed 1888-1891. The interdependence of these models shapes not just the way that disability is represented in the works examined, but also the way that disability functions in and shapes the narratives. Each chapter focuses on how medical and moral discourses related to a particular disability - blindness, madness, and stuttering - in contemporaneous philosophical, medical, journalistic, and promotional writings influenced the literary works examined. Throughout nineteenth-century America, the relationship between medical and moral models of disability produced a number of related discourses that tie into Foucault's concepts of disciplinary power and biopower: compulsory ablebodiedness; disability as an object of and barrier to sympathy; the push toward cure; the ability of diagnosis to reliably read pathological and moral defects; the connection between willpower, self-awareness, and ability; the benevolence of medicine; and the elevation of expertise. Some works of American nineteenth-century literature reinforce these discourses, others challenge them, and some exhibit a tension between the two positions.

Disability functions as a narrative device to speak to national debates in American culture and to comment on the very nature of storytelling and reading. Tyler's novel uses the cure of blindness to reflect on the proper way of seeing America and telling the story of becoming a proper American citizen. Poe's stories incorporate anxieties about madness and psychiatric diagnosis to address concerns about criminal responsibility and the role of  (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

I demonstrate that the understudied manuscripts belonging to a medical tradition called the Herbarium complex were in fact better suited to the needs of child-bearing communities than either the earlier medical books (e.g., the tenth-century Bald's Leechbook) or the new galenic medical texts arriving in England in the late eleventh century. Of all surviving medical books of the period, only the Herbarium complex was woman-oriented and treatment-oriented, as opposed to the infant- and knowledge-oriented medicine found in competing medical traditions. I also show that the Herbarium complex was the only medical book that was continuously used to treat patients from c. 950-1300; all other contemporary medical books were quickly displaced by the influx of new Arabic medicine c. 1070. Further, this research reveals which communities used which medical books: with its high proportion of medicine for conception and contraception, the Herbarium was uniquely suited to treat sexually active communities of lay women, where other medical books were reserved for celibate communities of monks and nuns.  Thus, this dissertation establishes for the first time that the Herbarium complex should be accorded a central position in our understanding of early and high medieval English medicine in general, and the treatment of woman patients in particular.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">This ethnographic case study of Argentine tango dancers in Cincinnati provides an in-depth understanding of how a transplanted traditional practice both evolves within, and adapts to, a new location, and – at the same time – catalyses the creation of social networks and liberated constructions of self in a new cultural context. Using Lave and Wenger's framework of a “Community of Practice” (CoP), I study the development of ethos, displays of affect, and address the role of gender and age identities.

The members of the Cincinnati Argentine tango CoP, although diverse in many ways, share a desire to devote much of their leisure time to an expressive embodied activity based upon a cultural export. The community created by the midwestern tango dancers is the product of a shared interest in a “foreign” cultural form and a desire to learn, rather than one formed with the aim of producing virtuosic public performers; such groups proliferate in cities across North America. Indeed, so common are such groups that they are regularly taken for granted and yet are central to the lives of those involved. 

The fact that Argentine tango ostensibly presents as an exotic cultural form when performed in the Midwest is not insignificant. In recent decades, folklorists have interrogated the concept of authenticity and increasingly found that studying how cultural exports develop in and adapt to new locations can be highly productive. In fact, it is largely because of tango's imported status that this Cincinnati CoP becomes such a fertile environment for investigation. Through their election to study an “imported” dance, these myriad Midwesterners gain access to an arena in which they can fashion themselves in an activity that demands extensive conscious dedication. Over time, the ways in which they involve themselves in the dance and its concomitant community (through, for example, their manner of learning, the events they choose to attend, their modes of interaction with others,  (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;"> The Orkney Islands are an archipelago located off of the northwest coast of Scotland. Heavily rural and exceptionally isolated, Orcadians have practiced the traditional occupations of fishing and farming dating back thousands of years, and are noted even among other Scots as being especially resilient and self-sufficient. The challenges they face - rural community destabilization, the slow death of traditional occupations, an identity in flux as the world becomes ever more interconnected - are not unique to Orkney, but the ways in which Orcadians have confronted these challenges are. 
This dissertation explores cultural and community resilience through three case studies. The first chapter is devoted to the role that traditional occupations play in North Atlantic fishing communities and Orcadian society more broadly, and how that role is evolving to meet the changing demands of a more globally integrated world. It focuses on the attitudes of fishers and farmers toward their work, and the ways that these groups are working to make sure their occupations remain relevant well into the future. The second chapter shifts focus to the budding tourism industry in Orkney, exploring some of the ways that Orcadians have worked (sometimes in vain) to manage the global tourism industry. This chapter is concerned with the impact that mass tourism is having on smaller Orcadian communities, and the creative ways that some island residents have attempted to seize on the tourism market for future economic stability as the operations of North Sea Oil wind down and traditional occupations continue to play less of a role in the island economy. The final chapter dives into questions of identity, exclusion, and group membership and focuses primarily on the place and experiences of Incomers - internal migrants from other parts of the United Kingdom - in small Orkney communities. This chapter navigates the fraught “incomer” category and explores the ways in which Orcadians of all varietie (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

But in a period when Christian belief and biblical knowledge permeated every aspect of human life, how did Paul's epistles inform Europe's robust literary and rhetorical cultures? How did scholars and artists respond, not only to Paul's provocative ideas, but also to his provocative manner of expressing these ideas? 

This dissertation is the first critical study of the reception and influence of Paul's rhetorical style in the Renaissance, 1500-1660. It explores creative uses of Pauline style across a range of mediums and genres – including drama, poetry, and oratory – at a time when the confluent cultural forces of humanism and Protestantism profoundly altered critical perceptions of Paul's prose. The dissertation argues that Pauline style developed into one of the most theoretically productive and artistically provocative styles of the period through a controversial process of critical evaluation. In their biblical scholarship, humanists used emerging methods of grammatical and rhetorical analysis to represent Paul's epistles as persuasive and eloquent to their readers, who often complained of Paul's inelegant, and apparently incoherent, manner of expression. This theoretical discourse directly impacted literary activity in England, shaping how and why authors adapted Pauline style in their texts. From the romance plays of William Shakespeare; to the metaphysical poetry of John Donne; to the courtly sermons of Lancelot Andrewes, English authors imitated Pauline style to produce aesthetic effects, reflect on theological problems, and engage in religious controversy. By thus tracing the reception of Pauline style, the dissertation reveals how English authors used biblical writing to shape their own rh (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

Europe, human flight had long captured the imaginations of scientific and literary
authors alike. Prior histories of flight begin with balloons, but earlier centuries
boasted a strange and colorful aviary that shaped thinking about flight long before
the first balloon ever left the ground. Taking a cultural materialist approach
informed by a broad familiarity with the development of early flight machines and a
deep familiarity with the literary conventions of the period, I analyze historical
materials ranging from aeronautical treatises to stage pantomimes, from newspaper
advertisements to philosophical poems, from mechanical diagrams to satirical
cartoons. This earlier culture possessed high hopes and anxieties about human
flight. I argue that early flight was lively and varied before the invention of a
successful flying machine, and that these early flights were important because they
established an aerial tradition astonishingly resistant to change. Rather than
revolutionizing the culture, ballooning was quickly incorporated into it. Although
ballooning came to be regarded as a failure by many onlookers, the aerial tradition
had long become accustomed to failure and continued unabated. Human flight has
always promised tremendous and yet debatable utility, a paradox that continues
into the present age.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

The Voices of David Foster Wallace: Comic, Encyclopedic, and Sincere offers a systematic analysis of Wallace's poetics of voice, identifying a dominant voice for each, pinpointing its techniques and influences, and casting it in a career arc of Wallace's evolving novelistic purposes. The careful shaping of voice is central to Wallace's distinctive prose and its impact on contemporary American fiction. The project identifies Wallace's three dominant voices—comic, encyclopedic, and sincere—and shows how voice identifies not just the particular agent communicating with the reader but creates a global atmosphere in texts, deeply shaping our experiences and interpretations. Drawing on and refining James Phelan's model of voice for Wallace's fiction, I define voice as the synthesis of values, tone, style, and rhythm, elements that come together in complex ways to create the gestalt effect of narrative voice. I develop tools for examining the micro elements that create the macro quality of the reading experience—helping illuminate how Wallace uses voice to “rewire” the way readers see and feel, changing our relation to language and to the world. Further, I emphasize the sonic dimension of reading whereby Wallace's sentence and paragraph rhythms impact the cognition of readers, thus joining the recent turn in literary studies toward reading with the grain, by advancing and synthesizing approaches to rhetoric, affect, formalism, and literary phenomenology. The picture of Wallace that emerges from my analysis is one of uncertainty (and ambition) regarding his place in the literary world, a restless desire to add more voices to his repertoire. Adopting comedy, knowledge, and finally emotional depth as his purposes, Wallace progressively widens his ideal audience, reaching readers in a variety of ways in his ongoing pr (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

Scholars across the fields of disability studies, digital media studies, and communication studies have documented transcription as a complex rhetorical practice; however, the strategies speech-to-text writers use when composing in real-time environments, and the composing methodologies and technologies that underlie them, remain severely understudied. This lack of knowledge is significant because it constrains advocacy for disabled people and their allies in naming and understanding specific forms of real-time transcription that best increase access to spaces that depend upon sound to convey meaning. This lack also puts educators and their institutions at a disadvantage when working to make classrooms more accessible for disabled students, faculty, and staff. I intervene by applying a disability-studies lens to original composition-based research to ask: “How do different speech-to-text writers write, and why do they write the way they do?” 

To answer this question, this study is divided into two phases of qualitative and quantitative data collection: (1) a survey of speech-to-text writers working at a large, Midwestern university; and (2) a comparative survey of English-speaking speech-to-text writers across the United States and Canada. Collected qualitative data are coded and analyzed following Adele Clarke's (2005) methods for situational analysis, and qualitative data are analyzed following Cindy Johanek's (2000) adapted methodological model for mixed-methods research, also known as the “contextualist research paradigm” (p. 27).

This study's most important findings reveal several major methodologies of transcription are currently in practice among professionals, and their differences tend to be hotly contested.

What are the “dominant” features and interactions at work in the literary period after postmodernism? How has literary realism changed under the influence of the new aesthetic dominant? My project combines Roman Jakobson's and Brian McHale's concept of the “dominant” with Peter J. Rabinowitz's and James Phelan's rhetorical narrative theory to develop a rhetorically-inflected approach to literary history. In this analytical framework, I identify characteristic and uncharacteristic rhetorical properties, purposes, interests, resources, processes, and engagements in particular works of literature, literary movements, and aesthetic dominants or literary periods and track change and/or continuity accordingly. When theorizing literary realism, I emphasize how representative authors foreground their audiences' interests and engagements with narrative's mimetic and thematic components. When conceptualizing the new aesthetic dominant, I point to an ethical one, oriented towards and engaged in various questions and inquiries about value and power. Then when characterizing “refracted realism,” I define its minimal conditions in terms of the foregrounding of the mimetic and thematic components and the ethical aesthetic dominant, even as “refraction”—representative authors' redeployment  (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

In Chapter One, I use women of color feminisms, Black feminisms, and queer of color critique (Cohen; Ferguson and Hong; Munoz; Chavez) to write a critical “herstoriography” (Garza; Lindsey) of rhetoric and composition's institutional policy statements after the Civil Rights Movement. Using these frameworks, I argue in Chapter Two that the increase in visibility of antiracist political agitation both “in the streets” and within rhetoric and composition via professional events such as the 2018 Conference on College Composition and Communication Conference (CCCC) in Kansas City renews opportunities to “rematerialize” (Melamed) the field's constructs of literacy, humanity, embodiment, space, and time. Extending this intervention to consider pedagogical and theoretical paradigms in the field, I then shift in the second half of the project to discuss rhetoric and composition's major pedagogical and theoretical paradigms. In Chapter Three, I look to the multimodal pedagogical and theoretical turn within rhetoric, composition, and digital media studies and its racialized, gendered, and sexualized erasures. I offer instead an alternative women of color feminist, Black feminist, and queer of color archive for theorizing about multimodality (Richardson; Nash; Miller-Young), and discuss my own attempts as a composition instructor to implement these frameworks in a Digital Media Composing course after Ferguson. Finally, in Chapter Four, my project concludes by considering Black feminist approaches to (new) materialist rhetorical criticism (Wynter; Weheliye).

Through survey, focus group, and individual interviews, and using Black feminist frameworks, this project documents how Black women's bodies and practices have traditionally been read as disruptive, and I argue noisy in quiet academic spaces (re: spaces governed by legacies of inequity and racism). 

Similar to intersectional frameworks, I suggest that noise is a multivocal representation of belonging that challenges legacies of mislabeling, dehumanizing, and silencing Black women GTAs and their bodies within institutional spaces. In order to centralize a discussion of Black women GTAs' noise, I turn to the contributions of Black feminist rhetorical scholars, literacy scholars, and Hip Hop scholars and ground my research in the noise itself--a multiplicitous and polyvocal understanding of Black women GTAs' lived experiences and practices as teachers of composition. In this sense, I highlight how and when Black women GTAs utilize intersectional instruction to retool their noise by relating their pedagogies to their epistemologies, pedagogical approaches, and networks of support inside and outside of their current home institutions. 

I suggest this retooling reflects what I refer to as Black women GTAs' “pedagogies of noise”—teaching approaches that acknowledge their confrontations with oppression and cultivate cultural knowledge production on a historical continuum through composition instruction and curriculum development. Ultimately, Pedagogies of Noise helps to challenge some of the gaps in the ways the fields of Composition Studies and Writing Program Administration (WPA) talk about composition teacher training, and who those current approaches to training do or do not serve.

Throughout this Interregnum, the country struggled to reestablish order after a civil war that had caused profound transformations in the civic structures, social hierarchies, gender relations, and religious identities of the body politic. I argue that, with these institutions and cultural frameworks still in flux, booksellers and editors repurposed the plays of Shakespeare, Thomas Middleton, Richard Brome, and other dramatists in order to attempt to reestablish social and political stability. Drawing on book historical methods that examine drama not only in terms of original performance conditions but also in terms of publication history, I explore the new and sometimes surprising meanings that early modern plays acquired when they were printed in republican England. My chapters demonstrate how a collection of Brome's anticourt satire, condemning the disorderly Cavaliers influenced by the defeated King Charles I, was intended to align drama with a republican political culture founded upon repudiation of the Caroline government; how Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice (1596) and Othello (1604) were appropriated to legitimize the idea that an aristocratic government would ensure internal harmony within a kingless state; how Middleton's proto-feminist plays More Dissemblers Besides Women (1614) and Women Beware Women (1621) were actually used to reinforce a patriarchal social order at a time of unprecedented political participation among women; and how William Davenant, the only playwright to stage drama during the 1650s, addressed similar political concerns when he produced operatic entertainments asse (open full item for complete abstract)</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">This dissertation investigates how students in a general education writing course characterize the material conditions that affect their composing efforts, especially their digital composing efforts. Much attention has rightfully been devoted to the material conditions of teachers and administrators, and how these material conditions impact teaching practices and labor. Little work has been done to study the relationship between student material conditions and their composing efforts. To address this gap, I gather interview data from student, instructor, and teaching assistant interviews to uncover which material conditions these course participants find most salient. I then apply the scholarship of political theorist Hannah Arendt to analyze student writing efforts as necessary labor, productive work, and/or public action. My findings indicate that instructors can transform necessary labor into productive work and/or public action by giving students time in class to compose, prioritizing access to course materials and technology, and responding to surveys that document the material factors students identify as significant to their composing efforts.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">Queer scholarship on history and historical media has tended toward the negative, emphasizing trauma, loss, injury, melancholia, and the like. This scholarship, in other words, posits a fundamentally negative relationship between queer subjects and their history, echoing Jameson's famous assertion that "history is what hurts." I argue that such fundamentally-negative relationships to history are neither inevitable nor intrinsic. Bringing together a variety of texts produced by and about queers, I demonstrate how queer writers, filmmakers, artists, and game designers since the 1980s have developed playful relationships to history that do not negate the realities of historical trauma but expand the affective registers with which the past might be engaged. These texts emphasize humor, joy, pleasure, and irreverence alongside trauma, treating the past as an open space for formal and affective play that allows for complex negotiations across time. Given the often-dark realities of queer history, such playful engagements with the past may seem counter-intuitive. But my research suggests that treating history as a space for play opens it up for queer subjects in unexpected and provocative ways. Rethinking how and why we engage with the past engenders reconsiderations of many ideas and logics that have been cast aside by queer studies because of their association with liberal, linear narratives of progress: genealogy, visibility, fantasy, even the notion of progress itself. Playing with the past allows queer artists the opportunity to explore these issues in complex and often counter-intuitive ways, demonstrating their utility when uncoupled from their association with linear narratives of progress. If history is what hurts and nothing more, how will we ever find anything but hurt when we turn backward?

Using The Life of Saint Katherine of Alexandria, The Book of Margery Kempe, and The Life of Dorothea of Montau, I argue that hagiography is not a closed genre governed by strict conventions, but instead a literary “place” in which social, institutional, and textual boundaries are tested. My research expands a queer historical and literary archive by examining medieval narratives that allow affective recognition between queer individuals and communities across historical periods. My research specifically traces the development of queer futures in medieval religious writing, identifying the political and textual affordances provided by the presence of these futures to nonnormative individuals and communities in the medieval period as well as the present. My dissertation foregrounds queer practices and relationships in medieval narratives, thereby expanding current understandings of medieval culture and sexuality. Reconsidering holy women through a queer lens challenges modern understandings of history that essentialize sexual identity in order to legitimize racist and sexist ideologies. My dissertation extends medieval sexuality beyond binary gender categories to account for religious representations of nonnormative sexuality and gender within the textual relationships between hagiographers and their subjects.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

Through interviews and observations of rhetors affiliated with an innovative inclusive education program pseudonymously titled “STEP” (“Successful Transitions and Educational Progress”), I offer a practice account of I/DD's relation to rhetoricity, or rhetorical capacity, in academic spaces. Contra to officialized discourses that portray self-advocacy as the responsibility of individual rhetors, I attend to self-advocacy's social and rhetorical dimensions across three “sites”: student self-advocacy practices, assessment technologies used to measure student self-determination, and the self-advocacy practices of professional self-advocates. After a methodological commentary on the need for qualitative researchers in rhetoric and writing studies to attend to accessibility as a practical and theoretical concern, I conclude by reflecting on the implications of my findings for rhetorical education writ large: specifically, for how teachers conceive of the relationship between collaboration and credibility in their classrooms.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

I define public discourse as political conversations, debates, and representations for reasoning that take place in the public sphere. I make this case in archival detail in four chapters. Chapter 1 focuses on celebrity poets as part of the media culture created by editor Robert Bonner in his blockbuster story paper the New York Ledger. Chapter 2 shifts from the East to the West coast, recovering the hemispheric Spanish-language poems in the first Spanish-language newspaper in California after the Mexican-American War, El Clamor Publico (the Public Outcry). Chapters 3 and 4 excavate the robust but largely unknown archives of newspaper poems circulating across the U.S. concerning the Panic of 1857 and the New York City cholera epidemic of 1866. This project is significant to the field of U.S. literary history, including the growing scholarship on the Latinx nineteenth century, for two primary reasons. First, the archive of periodical poems has not been completely recovered, categorized, or situated with respect to the larger currents of nineteenth-century public and print cultures. Second, scholars of the Latinx nineteenth century, including Rodrigo Lazo, Jesse Aleman, and Kirsten Silva Gruesz, have begun piecing together histories of the cultural productions of Latinx people using valuable but still incomplete archives. My dissertation contributes to the necessary work of reading Spanish- and English-language newspaper poems as related acts of public discourse reflecting a diverse U.S. media culture. </div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

              <p class="t-SearchResults-desc hide-class"><div style="overflow: hidden; height: 40px;">In recent years, American television has produced a seemingly endless stream of reimaginings (remakes, reboots, continuations). This dissertation focuses on reimaginings in which elements of characters' identities – such as race, gender, and sexuality – have been changed from what they were in the initial iterations. I analyze the impact (or lack thereof) that such changes have on production, narratives, and reception. The four reimaginings chosen for this project (Sci-Fi's Battlestar Galactica, The CW's Beauty and the Beast, Disney Channel's Girl Meets World, and Netflix's One Day at a Time) take a variety of approaches to handling the identity changes, often spurred by network and genre expectations. These series are sometimes discussed as progressive symbols, but I argue that they're typically little more than a sleight of hand. The changes obfuscate underlying desires to attain acclaim for improving the state of televisual representation while simultaneously avoiding moving past the basic level of visual change. This allows for the continued propagation of undesirable tropes and stereotypes. Central to my argument is an interrogation of current tensions that exist related to televisual representation, specifically between calls for increased inclusion in media and pervasive notions of postfemininity and postraciality. This conflict often manifests in casting practices that have complicated relationships with both narratives and audiences.</div> <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/#" data-ctrl="" class="">... <em>More</em></a></p>

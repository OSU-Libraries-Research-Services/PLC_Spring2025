LTN19700311-01.2.65,Mobile Float Parade Planned ,ARTICLE,11 March 1970,"<p dir=""auto"">Mobile Float Parade Planned</p><p dir=""auto"">Not since Maudine Ormsby , a University dairy cow , was elected Ohio State's 1926 Homecoming queen and was pulled around campus on a cart has the University had a Homecoming parade with mobile floats . Homecoming 1970 will be an exception . In recognition of Ohio State ' s 100 th anniversary , Traditions Board and the Student Centennial Committee are organizing the University ' s first multi-float Homecoming parade , a project requiring a great deal more planning than did the spontaneous ""one-float victory parade"" in 1926 . The parade , scheduled to precede the Oct . 17 football game with Minnesota , will replace the traditional Homecoming . decoration of living units .</p><p dir=""auto"">""We ' ve had no adverse reaction from the Greeks , as far as I know , "" said Deborah Craft , float committee chairman for the centennial committee and a member of Traditions Board . ""I would guess the parade would be welcomed with open arms since it will involve less expense than stable floats . "" She said last year Greeks spent as much as S 1 , 000 per house for Homecoming decorations . The centennial committee estimates mobile float expenses will be no more than $ 200 per float , she said . The centennial committee hopes as many as 80 to 100 units will participate in the parade , according to Lawrence Nuber , special arrangements chairman for the centennial committee . At least 50 per cent of . the units will be floats , he said . The</p><p dir=""auto"">remainder will include VIP cars , bands and special units such as antique cars . ""Everything so far is very tentative , "" Nuber said . ""It ' s difficult to plan specifics so far in advance . "" He said the centennial committee is striving for a workable method ol co-sponsoring floats between local merchants and University living units . Still Many Problems Many problems such as where the floats can be built , the route the parade will take , where equipment can be obtained and limitations on width , height and cost of floats hopefully will be worked out in the next few weeks , Nuber said . The centennial committee is ill j . the process of obtaining permission to construct the floats in and underneath the stadium .</p><p dir=""auto"">A tentative parade route has been mapped out , but this awaits approval by Columbus Safety Director James J . Hughes Jr ., Nuber said . Parade Route Set According to committee plans , the parade will move out of the stadium , south on Neil Avenue to 11 th Avenue , east on 11 th to N . High Street , past an Ohio Union reviewing stand where a judging panel and television cameras will be situated , north on High to 15 th Avenue , west on 15 th , and then around the Oval , where the floats will be on display throughout the weekend . Nuber said he anticipates no problems in blocking off traffic on the Oval since ""it is always I blocked off on football Saturdays anyway . "" The main question involves closing High Street , he said .</p>"

The ""Most Original"" trophy went to the ""Yellow Submarine"" float from Smith , Canfield and Morrison . A giant carnation peacock from Zeta Tau Alpha and Theta Tau won the ""Best Use of Theme"" trophy .

The new mobility for the 24 floats was the idea of the Centennial Students' Steering Committee , who ""wanted to do something different this year because of it being Centennial year , "" according to committee chairman Eric Grulke . Grulke , a senior from Berea , said the committee decided to have the mobile floats instead of the ""traditional stationary floats built in front of dorms and fraternity houses . "" The general theme of homecoming , ""Dawning of the Age , "" will be illustrated by floats with a social comment , according to Grulke . Of the 24 floats , Grulke said , "" some will be the typical 'Rah ! Rah ! ' floats , but most will be pertaining to social conditions . "" ""With one exception , the floats are all sponsored by organizations , such</p><p dir=""auto"">as fraternities and dormitories . The exception is a United Appeal float being built by Greeks who belong to houses that aren't themselves building a float , "" Grulke said . Donations for this float will pay for its construction . Any extra money , according to Grulke , will be given to the charity . Reed Varian , a senior from East Canton , "" came up with the idea for a United Appeal float and has done a great deal of work on it , "" Grulke said . This year ' s floats will cost less to build than in the past , according to Grulke , ""in recent years , some groups have spent over $ 1 , 000 to construct a float . This year the floats will only cost $ 200- $ 300 to build , because they ' re small . "" He added , ""the movable floats have to be small because of the traffic lights , trees and other obstacles that cross the parade route . "" The parade will form on East 12 th .</p><p dir=""auto"">at 8 : 30 Saturday morning for a fire inspection , according to Gurlke . ""We plan to start moving north on High Street at 9 : 15 , passing the Ohio Union where three or four faculty members will judge the floats , "" he added . Chairman of the parade committee , Bruno Sestito , a junior from Columbus , said the floats will move up High Street to Woodruff Avenue and will then turn left on Neil Ave . ""They will then move down Neil to South Oval Drive , where they will park during the football game , "" Sestito said . Prizes for the best floats won't be trophies as in the past , Grulke said . ""A group shows off its trophy for awhile and then puts it in a case , where it is usually forgotten . This year the organization with the best float will receive a scholarship , which should be worth about $ 100 , "" he said .</p>"

To eliminate the emphasis on Greek participation in campus traditions , candidates for May Queen and Homecoming Queen in 1969 were not allowed to publicize their sorority or organization affiliations . May Queen dropped The board succeeded in having all classes instead of only afternoon ones cancelled for May Day activities , and in 1970 the group eliminated May Queen altogether and put a greater emphasis on service activities instead of fun during May Week . The 1971 May Week ,</p><p dir=""auto"">planned despite the threat of a repeat of the Spring Quarter 1970 disturbances , included tutoring projects , a clean-up of off-campus alleys , a carnival , a rock concert , bed races and a speech by U . S . Sen . George McGovern , D-S . D . Homecoming has also been simplified . Greek houses , living units and dorms no longer compete for prizes won via elaborate and costly house donations . Many sororities and fraternities donate the $ 300 they might spend to decorate their lawn to a charity while others enter moveable floats in a Homecoming parade , a 1971 innovation .</p><p dir=""auto"">For coeds only The Homecoming Queen is no longer selected by a University-wide campaign featuring skits and a talent competition . Candidates fill out a questionnaire screened by a panel of persons not affiliated with the University who eventually select five contestants .</p><p dir=""auto"">The origins of Homecoming and May Week have been obscured by the changes . Originally May Day was a stately affair for coeds only . The first May Day was sponsored in 1909 by the Women ' s Student Council and was climaxed when senior women dressed as nymphs , raindrops , clouds and the wind danced the minuet in Mirror Lake Hollow . By the 1920 ' s men joined the festivities then known as Traditions Week which cli</p><p dir=""auto"">Ugly Man</p><p dir=""auto"">maxed in 1925 when police armed with blackjacks were called to Bucket and Dipper ( junior men ' s honorary ) initiations when some members tried to throw unwilling freshmen into Mirror Lake . Queen cow The May Week Auction , discontinued in the 1960 s , featured the "" sale"" of University officials to students , such as John T . Bonner , vice president for educational services .</p><p dir=""auto"">whose services as a butler were once purchased for $ 26 . Homecoming highlights include 1926 when Maudine Ormsby , a prize Holstein cow from the agriculture college , was named queen and later disqualified . In 1935 elections were confused , too . when Rosina Dienlein and her identical twin Mary ran for queen . Agnes Heskett won and several law students threatened to abduct her when their proposal tc have queen candidates parade across tables in the library was overruled by the Administration . A la Miss America Dad ' s Day , a football Saturday when one student ' s father is the special guest ol</p><p dir=""auto"">the University , was changed to Parents' Weekend in 1969 . Formerly , students wrote essays of 25 words or less on why their fathers should be selected for the honor , but the event was enlarged to include invitations for all parents to attend the special game and the essay contest was eliminated . Another campus tradition , Golddiggers King , was also eliminated in 1969 . Dating back to 1936 this annual winter dance featured coeds buying the dance and dinner tickets , opening doors and escorting their boyfriends home . Everything from slide rules to vegetables to false teeth was used by coeds to</p><p dir=""auto"">construct corsages for their dates . Once only an all-girl affair called the ""Coed Prom , "" three boys crashed the event in 1915 and a tradition was born . It soon died as elaborate election procedures for selecting the handsomest male on campus sprang up , including talent contests and personality interviews a la Miss America . Demented Duck Golddigger competition in 1968 , the last year before the tradition was dropped because of lack of interest , included skits ""highlighted "" by Robert Musson ' s sixminute monologue on the reactions of a new night watchman as King Kong</p><p dir=""auto"">climbs up the outside of the Empire State Building . While handsome Golddigger kings have been dropped from campus tradition , the annual Ugly Man On Campus contest , sponsored by Alpha Phi Omega service fraternity to aid area charities , fares much better . Young men transformed into hideous monsters via silly putty , paint , false noses and wigs stalk the campus grabbing unsuspecting coeds and demanding a donation for their favorite charity . This year such uglies as Gutter Snipe , Captain America , Tommy Trustee , Greasy Rider , Hairy Question and Demented Duck raised $ 2 , 100 for charity .</p><p dir=""auto"">May Week</p>"

It was billed ""The Dawning of the Age , "" but for at least one fan in Ohio Stadium Saturday , it was just another football game . ""You mean today ' s Homecoming ?"" asked an incredudous senior sitting in section 13 A . ""Where have you been all week ?"" countered the girl sitting beside him . ""Didn't you see the queen candidates , the signs to buy mums , the floats on High Street this morning . You ' re putting me on . You mean , you really didn't know it was Homecoming ?"" The boy slowly shook his head and started to speak but the girl looked away in disgust . ""You ' re impossible , man , really unbelievable , "" she said . But he wasn ' t alone . There were several persons on High Street Saturday morning watching the crepe paper floats pass by who didn't recognize Homecoming , either . And . there ,, were ., many , more parade watchers who weren't- aware that it was ""the dawning of a new age . "" What do you think of ""The Dawning of the Age"" activities , I asked 20 people standing at 15 th and high .</p><p dir=""auto"">""Well , I like the way they run the queen contest now , without all the expense of</p><p dir=""auto"">skits for each girl , but you really can't tell "" it's Homecoming by walking down 15 th Avenue , "" answered a petite girl in a plaid pantsuit . ""You don't see any hammers and nails , crepe paper and chicken wire or anything else that resembles a float . "" ""I remember when my parents brought me up here on Saturday mornings when I was in grade school to see the floats and I loved it . But I guess times change , "" she added . ""Well , I don't like it , and you can write that down . "" Your name , please . ""My name isn't important . I still don't like it , "" said a young man clad in a navy peajacket and bell-bottomed jeans . ""First they change Homecoming and eliminate May Queen . Then they try to tear down University Hall and put chicken franchises all up and down High Street in place of the old campus hangouts . I don't like what they ' re doing . They ? I asked . ""Yeah , they . All these super-cool people who've got to change everything to make it relevant . The ones who throw out tradition but don't have anything to put in its place . I guess I ' m square , but I enjoy watching queen skits even if I don't know the girls . And I like Homecoming lfoats that sit on the fraternity and sorority lawns and don't have 106 movable parts . "" ""Well , I think Homecoming is a waste of</p><p dir=""auto"">time , "" added a young man in a business suit coming out of Long ' s Bookstore . ""You spend all that money and you ' ve got nothing to show for it . You elect a queen and forget her name two days later . Why should we cater to the alumni when we ' re the ones paying the bills and going to school ?"" And what do you think ? I asked a middleaged woman in a flowered raincoat who was standing at 15 th and High . ""I think they changed Homecoming because they were afraid to plan anything elaborate like last spring ' s May Week that might get canceled because of student disturbances . You have only yourselves to blame for all the changes that've been made . If you'd buckle down and study instead of sitting on the Oval chanting , America would still have her traditions intact . "" The three students immediately began arguing with her and she walked away . The girl in the plaid pantsuit excused herself and hurried down 15 th Avenue saying , ""I really have nothing more to say , "" leaving the two young men , one in a business suit and the other in jeans , arguing loudly on the corner . Harmony and understanding ? Sympathy and trust abounding ? If Saturday signalled the dawning of a new age , I think I prefer the dusk of the old one .</p>"
LTN19701016-01.2.19,Social Work students vote on plan ,ARTICLE,16 October 1970,"<p dir=""auto"">Social Work students vote on plan</p><p dir=""auto"">By JAMES MOSKUS Lantern Special Writer Votes to be tabulated Oct . 20 will indicate whether the 657 students of the School of Social Work have accepted a proposal that appears to give them more than a 50 per cent representation on most faculty committees .</p><p dir=""auto"">A group of students last Spring struck the school as a result of the schools' rejection of a 50-50 representation proposal for all school committees . The document to be voted upon is called the Student-Faculty Proposals for Student Representation in the Governance of the School of Social Work . A committee composed of undergraduates , graduates and faculty spent the summer drafting the proposal . Representation varies The nine Program Committees would vary in number of student representatives from three to six members . James O . Billups , assistant director of the School of Social Work , said that only two or three faculty members would be on each of these committees . This would give a clear majority of students on each committee . In addition to student representation on committees , a Student Assembly would be formed by elected students from all committees . A total of 53 students would comprise the Assembly . Although students will have more than 50 per cent representation on</p><p dir=""auto"">committees , decisions should be arrived at by consensus . This hope was expressed by Milton S . Rosner , professor of Social Work and a member of the committee which drafted the proposal . Two main groups If the vote is affirmative , students will elect representatives to committees in two main groups : Sequence and Program . Sequence deals with curricula and Program with school policy . Rosner called it ""pluralistic decision making . He thinks that a proposal would be solved in one of the Sequence or Program Committees . Because of the variety of committees and the flexibility in the system to create even more committees , Rosner does not feel that a stand off between the Student Assembly and the Committee of Faculty will occur . Plan is realistic ""It ' s more realistic than a 50-50 representation , "" said Stanley Szalak , a graduate student from Lancaster , Pa . Gary Logan , a graduate from Columbus and a member of the Drafting Committee , said that if the vote were affirmative it would not be a constitution , but an operating document for all .</p><p dir=""auto"">Logan , and Kay Smith , a senior from Columbus , think that the only concern that might defeat the Proposal would be students' skepticism . ""It may seem too good to be true , "" Logan said . Richard R . Medhurst , director of the School of Social Work , said that previous student recommendations for representation "" were not structured . "" Student input allowed Medhurst said this is a system ""that will allow student inputs into all areas of the School of Social Work . The system is cumbersome , but that's the price of involvement , "" he said . Medhurst said there is a need for student involvement in all levels of the University and he feels the University is moving in this direction . Marlene Deutsch , a senior from New York and a participant in last Spring ' s strike against the school , said ""It will work if students take an interest in it . "" She thinks the faculty and administration are truly making an effort to work with students . One undergraduate and one graduate student would be elected from each section of each course in the five sequences in the School of Social Work .</p><p dir=""auto"">FIJI FLOAT—Members of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity prepare their Homecoming float for Saturday morning ' s parade down High Street .

Police</p><p dir=""auto"">UPI photo CANADIAN PRIME Minister Pierre Trudeau motions security men away as Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin , in topcoat , leaves Parliament Hill after a</p><p dir=""auto"">2 '/ i-hour meeting with members of Parliament . Security was tight everywhere after a demonstrator jumped on Kosygin Monday .</p><p dir=""auto"">intended to keep protesters five blocks from the embassy in every direction . While authorities were preparing for an organized parade protesting alleged mistreatment of Soviet Jews , Kosygin was having another round of what were described as solidly businesslike discussions with Prime</p><p dir=""auto"">Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and other Canadian leaders . On the public front , the only Canadians who seemed to take notice of the visit were those with protests to make and axes to grind , and they have created a nightmare for both Soviet and Canadian authorities . The protests may dog the trip in</p><p dir=""auto"">other cities . Busloads of protesters already have been heading toward Montreal , where Kosygin is due Thursday for an overnight stay , and other demonstrations are promised for Edmonton , Vancouver and Toronto . A ram ' s horn signaled the beginning of the Ottawa march . The protesters formed up behind a group of rabbis and started toward a semicircle of several hundred police . Young parade marshals formed a barrier in front of the police to insure no contact with the protesters . A sprinkling of young men carried blue and white flags bearing a clenched fist inside a star — the insignia of the militant , New York-based Jewish Defense League . Rabbi Meir Kahane , leader of the league , and six companions were turned back to New Yrok after arriving in Montreal . Men with megaphones led chants — ""Let our people go , "" and ""Free Soviet Jewry . "" But the crowd was</p><p dir=""auto"">more picnic than protet in atmosphere , dispite the chant and the placards . The atmosphere was friendly . Security was far tighter Tuesday because of the attempt by a young man to assault Kosygin the day before . Geza Matrai , the 27-year-old Hungarian accused of assaulting Kosygin on Monday , it being held in custody until his case comes up in court next week . Kosygin ' s continuing talks with Canadian leaders again focused on international affairs and included a long exchange of views on the Middle East . Both nations support the United Nations' 1967 resolution calling for Israel ' s withdrawal from occupied Arab territories . Spokesmen said there was no discussion of either Vietnam or Red China , nor did either side mention the current Canadian grievances against the United States because of Washington ' s economic policies .</p><p dir=""auto"">STEADY THEREI Skating on the Oval for United Appeal is homecoming queen candidate Jill Eversole , 19 , a sophomore from Baltimore , Ohio .

LTN19700423-01.2.45,Centennial Spending Seems Like Millions ,ARTICLE,23 April 1970,"<p dir=""auto"">Centennial Spending Seems Like Millions</p><p dir=""auto"">Appearances Are Misleading</p><p dir=""auto"">By SHIRLEY BROWNELL Lantern Staff Writer The University appears to have struck it rich in financing its Centennial Year activities . To judge from the success and caliber of the programs , one would think the University had millions to spend rather than a total budget of only $ 130 , 000 . According to Frederick Stecker , centennial coordinator , the Board of Trustees provided the University with $ 100 , 000 , taken from special funds , for the Centennial celebration . This , together with $ 30 , 000 contributed by the University ' s Development Fund , is the Centennial Committee ' s only source of revenue , Stecker said . The key to the program ' s success , Stecker believes , is the involvement of people , their enthusiasm , as well as the caliber of people on the various committees . The interest in the program is widespread , he said , attributing it , in part , to the fact that it will be "" another 100 years before we'll get a chance to do something like this . ""</p><p dir=""auto"">Stecker said $ 65 , 000 of the total budget was distributed to the various colleges which were asked to provide Centennial programs for students , faculty and alumni . Each college requesting funds and which came forward with "" an enrichment program"" was given $ 3 , 800 . he said . A similar amout was given to the Centennial Student Steering Committee for student programming , while $ 3 , 000 went to the library and $ 2 , 800 to University College for special projects , Stecker said . The remaining $ 65 , 000 has gone for publicity , Centennial signs for lampposts , 10 C Centennial citations tc replace the Distinguished Service Awards , mainten</p><p dir=""auto"">ance and contingency fund . Stecker said $ 15 , 000 was also given to the Department of Photography for production of a ""low cost "" documentary film on the University . The film was shown during Charter Weekend and has been featured on television , he added . The list of articles bearing the Centennial symbol is astounding . It includes calendars , name tags , book marks for all new library books , postage meter cancellation stamps , place mats and sugar packets for use in residence halls , letterheads as well as athletic and entertainment tickets . Another item , the Scarlet and Gray automobile license tags , were produced at no cost to the University or the Centennial Committee . Stecker explained that the University made a request to Gov . James A . Rhodes that license plates carry the</p><p dir=""auto"">colors scarlet and gray in 1970 , in recognition of Ohio State ' s Centennial year . Other Centennial projects include a pictorial history of 100 University leaders of the past . The book is being printed by the University Press and Stecker hopes sales will pay for the production cost . Also , the histories of the various departments are being updated at no cost to the Centennial Committee . Charter Weekend and other Alumni Association activities are being paid for from special revenues , Richard M . Mall , director of alumni affairs said . He estimates a final cost of $ 40 , 000 to $ 50 , 000 for the association ' s Centennial programs . Revenue has come from the sale of commemorative portraits , momemtos and from alumni - sponsored tours , Mall said . There is no tax money involved nor has the money come essentially from membership funds , he</p><p dir=""auto"">said . The association also produced commemorative medallions at an estimated cost of $ 10 , 000 . The medallion was designed by an alumnus , Milton Caniff , free of charge , Stecker said . Many were presented to outstanding alumni during Charter Weekend . The Centennial Student Steering Committee neither asked for nor received allocation from student fees , T . Rodney Swearingen , student adviser said . The group has operated solely on the $ 3 , 800 given it by the University . According to Leni Rosenfield , committee co-chair-man , the Centennibration cake cost approximately $ 500 and was paid for by an alumnus . She said aid to the student group has also come in the form of publicity , paid for by the Alumni Association . The next student-sponsored event will be the float parade during Homecoming . There is little cost involved in the float parade , Swearingen</p><p dir=""auto"">said , because the usual ""house"" decorations will be transferred to the floats . Most of the colleges have gone further , Stecker said , in seeking funds from other sources for their programs . One of the most enterprising has been the College of Education . According to D . Alexander Severino , associate dean , the College of Education has set up 11 alumni districts within Ohio and one out-of-state , to raise money . So far , more than $ 14 , 000 has been raised , Severino said , and he estimated that the final amount may reach $ 20 , 000 . The money , he said , is going towards a series of conferences sponsored by the college and towards commemorating certain issues of the college ' s quarterly magazine , ""Theory Into Practice , "" ( TIP ) to the Centennial . Rather than hold symposiums and conferences , University , College asked the Centennial Committee for $ 2 , 800 , to put together a</p><p dir=""auto"">centennial display to be used throughout the state . The display illustrates "" undergraduate learning at Ohio State over the past 100 years , "" Robert A . Barnes , director of the Newark Campus said . The display shows a lighted Centennial symbol and projects color slides of undergraduate learning , he said . Mervin G . Smith , assistant dean , hopes that part of the money given to the College of Agriculture and Home Economics will go towards a sculpture now in the planning state . The sculpture , to be set up on West Campus , will indicate past and future development , Smith said . It will pertain to agriculture , agricultural industry , rural people and food distribution in the world . The college has received other contributions , Smith said , and has raised money from registration and fees for conferences and meetings held . The College of Humanities pooled its funds with the</p><p dir=""auto"">Graduate School , now observing the 10 th Annual Conference of Humanities , in order to get better speakers . The college sponsored the University Dance Company ' s presentation of 18 th to 20 th century dance forms to ""illustrate changes the humanities have gone through in the last 100 years , "" Professor Harold J . Grimm said . The College of the Arts spent some $ 10 , 000 for the Beethoven concert during Charter Weekend , Dean Lee Rigsby said , but made it back at the box office . He believes the Jerome Lawrence-Robert E . Lee play , ""The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail , "" which premieres here April 21 , will pay for itself as did the dance concert in March . Funds given to the college by the Centennial Committee will go towards a big exhibit slated for November which will portray Ohio at the turn r pf the century , Rigsby said ,, J In addition to its $ 3 , 888 , ' t ^ e College of Optometry has re</p><p dir=""auto"">ceived $ 7 , 000 from the Sheard Foundation . Together with the Department of Ophtalmology and the Institute for Research and Vision , the college ' s activities include a centennial conference in visual science in November . Professor George E . Briggs believes activities of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences may cost an additional $ 10 , 000 . The college plans a symposium and two conferences later this year , and Briggs believes the final cost will depend on the availability and prominence of speakers . The College of Mathematics and Physical Sciences is matching funds given it by the Centennial Committee and may underwrite certain other costs , professor Philip Jastram said . Neither the College of Law</p><p dir=""auto"">nor the College of Administrative Science have sought additional funds . According to Mrs . Kathie Dickhaut , public relations associate , half of the money given to the College of Administrative Science went toward the purchasing of Centennial Distinguished Service Awards which were given to 144 persons of the college and profession . The College of Engineering requested no funds , choosing instead to give Centennial emphasis to a project already undertaken . One of the few complaints coming out of the Centennial planning is that students have not been involved enough in some of the programs , Stecker said . Several students questioned showed little or no interest</p><p dir=""auto"">in centennial activities . Pamela Dresbach , University College-1 , said the programs hold no meaning for her because she would like to see "" more studentoriented programs rather than conferences . "" Karl Zilka , Arts-2 , said he hasn ' t given the activities a thought . He said he knows of Centennial year only because he reads about it in the Lantern . Zilka said he would like to see the University sponsor a ""big , informal anniversary party"" or something special to involve students . James Fox , Medicine-2 , said he hasn ' t heard medical students or friends of his talk about the Centennial . He blames his lack of interest on the fact that he is more concerned with studying or doing something else . There hasn ' t been much student participation except for the Centennibration , Kathy Melko , Allied Medicine-1 , said . She said the only symposiums she has heard of have not been open to students , adding that if there have been student activities they have not been</p><p dir=""auto"">publicized enough . Karen Zuga , Arts-2 , said that while having a centennial year and celebrating is good for the University , its goal should be directed , not towards a party , but to improvements . ""The University should take an in-depth look at the academic program , the University as a whole and try to improve it , "" she said . Symposiums are a good idea , Miss Zuga said , adding however , that in its Centennial year the University should look to the future and to what has to be done . She said she is uninterested in the events going on because she is more involved in getting through school and with her dormitory . Karl Gruber , University College-1 , said ""its cool that the University is celebrating its 100 th year , but it ' s getting too big . "" Gruber believes students are too busy having fun or</p><p dir=""auto"">studying to find the Centennial relevant , and he believes observing its 100 th year is "" good advertisement for the school . "" William B . Hall , Administrative Science-4 , has found the Centennial programs useful and good . The University is using the Centennial to "" see where its been in the last 100 years and where its going , "" he said . The programs are relevant to students , whether they know it or not , Hall said .</p>"
